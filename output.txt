ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Diana Kormos Buchwald, the general editor of Einstein�s papers, read this
book  meticulously  and  made  copious  comments  and  corrections  through
many drafts. In addition, she helped me get early and complete access to the
wealth  of  new  Einstein  papers  that  became  available  in  2006,  and  guided
me  through  them.  She  was  also  a  gracious  host  and  facilitator  during  my
trips  to  the  Einstein  Papers  Project  at  Caltech.  She  has  a  passion  for  her
work  and  a  delightful  sense  of  humor,  which  would  have  pleased  her
subject.

Two of her associates were also very helpful in guiding me through the
newly  available  papers  as  well  as  untapped  riches  in  the  older  archival
material. Tilman  Sauer, who likewise  checked  and annotated  this book, in
particular vetted the sections on Einstein�s quest for the equations of general
relativity  and  his  pursuit  of  a  unified  field  theory.  Ze�ev  Rosenkranz,  the
historical  editor  of  the  papers,  provided  insights  on  Einstein�s  attitudes
toward  Germany  and  his  Jewish  heritage.  He  was  formerly  curator  of  the
Einstein archives at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

Barbara Wolff, who is now at those archives at Hebrew University, did a
careful  fact-checking  of  every  page  of  the  manuscript,  making  fastidious
corrections  large  and  small.  She  warned  that  she  has  a  reputation  as  a
nitpicker,  but  I  am  very  grateful  for  each  and  every  nit  she  found.  I  also
appreciate the encouragement given by Roni Grosz, the curator there.

Brian  Greene,  the  Columbia  University  physicist  and  author  of  The
Fabric of the Cosmos, was an indispensable friend and editor. He talked me
through  numerous  revisions,  honed  the  wording  of  the  science  passages,
and read the final manuscript. He is a master of both science and language.
In  addition  to  his  work  on  string  theory,  he  and  his  wife,  Tracy  Day,  are
organizing  an  annual  science  festival  in  New  York  City,  which  will  help
spread the enthusiasm for physics so evident in his work and books.

 
Lawrence  Krauss,  professor  of  physics  at  Case  Western  Reserve  and
author of Hiding in the Mirror, also read my manuscript, vetted the sections
on  special  relativity,  general  relativity,  and  cosmology,  and  offered  many
good suggestions and corrections. He, too, has an infectious enthusiasm for
physics.

Krauss  helped  me  enlist  a  prot�g�  of  his  at  Case,  Craig  J.  Copi,  who
teaches relativity there. I hired him to do a thorough checking of the science
and math, and I am grateful for his diligent edits.

Douglas Stone, professor of physics at Yale, also vetted the science in the
book. A condensed matter theorist, he is writing what will be an important
book  on  Einstein�s  contributions  to  quantum  mechanics.  In  addition  to
checking my science sections, he helped me write the chapters on the 1905
light  quanta  paper,  quantum  theory,  Bose-Einstein  statistics,  and  kinetic
theory.

Murray  Gell-Mann,  winner  of  the  1969  Nobel  Prize  in  physics,  was  a
delightful  and  passionate  guide  from  the  beginning  to  the  end  of  this
project. He helped me revise early drafts, edited and corrected the chapters
on  relativity  and  quantum  mechanics,  and  helped  draft  sections  that
explained  Einstein�s  objections 
to  quantum  uncertainty.  With  his
combination  of  erudition  and  humor,  and  his  feel  for  the  personalities
involved, he made the process a great joy.

Arthur I. Miller, emeritus professor of history and philosophy of science
at  University  College,  London,  is  the  author  of  Einstein,  Picasso  and  of
Empire  of  the  Stars.  He  read  and  reread  the  versions  of  my  scientific
chapters  and  helped  with  numerous  revisions,  especially  on  special
relativity (about which he wrote a pioneering book), general relativity, and
quantum theory.

Sylvester  James  Gates  Jr.,  a  physics  professor  at  the  University  of
Maryland, agreed to read my manuscript when he came out to Aspen for a
conference  on  Einstein.  He  did  a  comprehensive  edit  filled  with  smart
comments and rephrasing of certain scientific passages.

John  D.  Norton,  a  professor  at  the  University  of  Pittsburgh,  has
specialized  in  tracing  Einstein�s  thought  process  as  he  developed  both
special and then general relativity. He read these sections of my book, made
edits,  and  offered  useful  comments.  I  am  also  grateful  for  guidance  from
two  of  his  fellow  scholars  specializing  in  Einstein�s  development  of  his

theories:  J�rgen  Renn  of  the  Max  Planck  Institute  in  Berlin  and  Michel
Janssen of the University of Minnesota.

George Stranahan, a founder of the Aspen Center for Physics, also agreed
to read and review the manuscript. He was particularly helpful in editing the
sections  on  the  light  quanta  paper,  Brownian  motion,  and  the  history  and
science of special relativity.

Robert  Rynasiewicz,  a  philosopher  of  science  at  Johns  Hopkins,  read
many of the science chapters and made useful suggestions about the quest
for general relativity.

N. David Mermin, professor of theoretical physics at Cornell and author
of  It�s  About  Time:  Understanding  Einstein�s  Relativity,  edited  and  made
corrections  to  the  final  version  of  the  introductory  chapter  and  chapters  5
and 6 on Einstein�s 1905 papers.

Gerald  Holton,  professor  of  physics  at  Harvard,  has  been  one  of  the
pioneers in the study of Einstein, and he is still a guiding light. I am deeply
flattered  that  he  was  willing  to  read  my  book,  make  comments,  and  offer
generous encouragement. His Harvard colleague Dudley Herschbach, who
has done so much for science education, also was supportive. Both Holton
and Herschbach made useful comments on my draft and spent an afternoon
with  me  in  Holton�s  office  going  over  suggestions  and  refining  my
descriptions of the historical players.

Ashton Carter, professor of science and international  affairs at  Harvard,
kindly read and checked an early draft. Columbia University�s Fritz Stern,
author of Einstein�s German World, provided encouragement and advice at
the  outset.  Robert  Schulmann,  one  of  the  original  editors  at  the  Einstein
Papers Project, did likewise. And Jeremy Bernstein, who has written many
fine books on Einstein, warned me how difficult the science would be. He
was right, and I am grateful for that as well.

In addition, I asked two teachers of high school physics to give the book
a  careful  reading  to  make  sure  the  science  was  correct,  and  also
comprehensible  to  those  whose  last  physics  course  was  in  high  school.
Nancy  Stravinsky  Isaacson  taught  physics  in  New  Orleans  until,  alas,
Hurricane Katrina gave her more free time. David Derbes teaches physics at
the University of Chicago Lab School. Their comments were very incisive
and also aimed at the lay reader.

There is a corollary of the uncertainty principle that says that no matter
how  often  a  book  is  observed,  some  mistakes  will  remain.  Those  are  my

fault.

It also helped to have some nonscientific readers, who made very useful
suggestions from a lay perspective on parts or all of the manuscript. These
included  William  Mayer,  Orville  Wright,  Daniel  Okrent,  Steve  Weisman,
and Strobe Talbott.

For twenty-five years, Alice Mayhew at Simon & Schuster has been my
editor  and  Amanda  Urban  at  ICM  my  agent.  I  can  imagine  no  better
partners, and they were again enthusiastic and helpful in their comments on
the  book.  I  also  appreciate  the  help  of  Carolyn  Reidy,  David  Rosenthal,
Roger Labrie, Victoria Meyer, Elizabeth Hayes, Serena Jones, Mara Lurie,
Judith Hoover, Jackie Seow, and Dana Sloan at Simon & Schuster. For their
countless acts of support over the years, I am also grateful to Elliot Ravetz
and Patricia Zindulka.

Natasha  Hoffmeyer  and  James  Hoppes  translated  for  me  Einstein�s
German  correspondence  and  writing,  especially  the  new  material  that  had
not  yet  been  translated,  and  I  appreciate  their  diligence.  Jay  Colton,  who
was photo editor for Time�s Person of the Century issue, also did a creative
job tracking down pictures for this book.

I had two and a half other readers who were the most valuable of all. The
first was my father, Irwin Isaacson, an engineer who instilled in me a love
of science and is the smartest teacher I�ve ever had. I am grateful to him for
the universe that he and my late mother created for me, and to my brilliant
and wise stepmother, Julanne.

The other truly valuable reader was my wife, Cathy, who read every page
with  her  usual  wisdom,  common  sense,  and  curiosity.  And  the  valuable
half-a-reader was my daughter,Betsy, who as usual read selected portions of
my book. The surety with which she made her pronouncements made up for
the randomness of her reading. I love them both dearly.

needed for general relativity.

FRITZ HABER (1868�1934). German chemist and gas warfare pioneer
who helped recruit Einstein to Berlin and mediated between him
and Mari . A Jew who converted to Christianity in an attempt to
be  a  good  German,  he  preached  to  Einstein  the  virtues  of
assimilation, until the Nazis came to power.

CONRAD HABICHT (1876�1958). Mathematician and amateur inventor,

Polytechnic  who  became  Einstein�s  first  wife.  Mother  of  Hans
Albert,  Eduard,  and  Lieserl.  Passionate  and  driven,  but  also
brooding and increasingly gloomy, she triumphed over many, but
not  all,  of  the  obstacles  that  then  faced  an  aspiring  female
physicist. Separated from Einstein in 1914, divorced in 1919.

ROBERT  ANDREWS  MILLIKAN  (1868�1953).  American  experimental

CHAPTER ONE
THE LIGHT-BEAM RIDER

�I  promise  you  four  papers,�  the  young  patent  examiner  wrote  his  friend.
The letter would turn out to bear some of the most significant tidings in the
history of science, but its momentous nature was masked by an impish tone
that was typical of its author. He had, after all, just addressed his friend as
�you  frozen  whale�and  apologized  for  writing  a 
that  was
�inconsequential  babble.�  Only  when  he  got  around  to  describing  the
papers,  which  he  had  produced  during  his  spare  time,  did  he  give  some
indication that he sensed their significance.1

letter 

�The  first  deals  with  radiation  and  the  energy  properties  of  light  and  is
very  revolutionary,�  he  explained.  Yes,  it  was  indeed  revolutionary.  It
argued that light could be regarded not just as a wave but also as a stream of
tiny  particles  called  quanta.  The  implications  that  would  eventually  arise
from  this  theory�a  cosmos  without  strict  causality  or  certainty�would
spook him for the rest of his life.

�The  second  paper  is  a  determination  of  the  true  sizes  of  atoms.�  Even
though  the  very  existence  of  atoms  was  still  in  dispute,  this  was  the  most
straightforward of the papers, which is why he chose it as the safest bet for
his  latest  attempt  at  a  doctoral  thesis.  He  was  in  the  process  of
revolutionizing physics, but he had been repeatedly thwarted in his efforts
to win an academic job or even get a doctoral degree, which he hoped might
get  him  promoted  from  a  third-  to  a  second-class  examiner  at  the  patent
office.

The  third  paper  explained  the  jittery  motion  of  microscopic  particles  in
liquid by using a statistical analysis of random collisions. In the process, it
established that atoms and molecules actually exist.

�The  fourth  paper  is  only  a  rough  draft  at  this  point,  and  is  an
electrodynamics  of  moving  bodies  which  employs  a  modification  of  the

 
time.�  Well, 

than
theory  of  space  and 
inconsequential  babble.  Based  purely  on  thought  experiments�performed
in  his  head  rather  than  in  a  lab�he  had  decided  to  discard  Newton�s
concepts of absolute space and time. It would become known as the Special
Theory of Relativity.

that  was  certainly  more 

What  he  did  not  tell  his  friend,  because  it  had  not  yet  occurred  to  him,
was that he would produce a fifth paper that year, a short addendum to the
fourth,  which  posited  a  relationship  between  energy  and  mass.  Out  of  it
would arise the best-known equation in all of physics: E=mc2.

Looking back at a century that will be remembered for its willingness to
break classical bonds, and looking ahead to an era that seeks to nurture the
creativity  needed  for  scientific  innovation,  one  person  stands  out  as  a
paramount icon of our age: the kindly refugee from oppression whose wild
halo  of  hair,  twinkling  eyes,  engaging  humanity,  and  extraordinary
brilliance  made  his  face  a  symbol  and  his  name  a  synonym  for  genius.
Albert Einstein was a locksmith blessed with imagination and guided by a
faith  in  the  harmony  of  nature�s  handiwork.  His  fascinating  story,  a
testament  to  the  connection  between  creativity  and  freedom,  reflects  the
triumphs and tumults of the modern era.

Now  that  his  archives  have  been  completely  opened,  it  is  possible  to
explore how the private side of Einstein�his nonconformist personality, his
instincts as a rebel, his curiosity, his passions and detachments�intertwined
with his political side and his scientific side. Knowing about the man helps
us understand the wellsprings of his science, and vice versa. Character and
imagination and creative genius were all related, as if part of some unified
field.

Despite his reputation for being aloof, he was in fact passionate in both
his personal and scientific pursuits. At college he fell madly in love with the
only woman in his physics class, a dark and intense Serbian named Mileva
Mari .  They  had  an  illegitimate  daughter,  then  married  and  had  two  sons.
She served as a sounding board for his scientific ideas and helped to check
the  math  in  his  papers,  but  eventually  their  relationship  disintegrated.
Einstein offered her a deal. He would win the Nobel Prize someday, he said;
if she gave him a divorce, he would give her the prize money. She thought
for  a  week  and  accepted.  Because  his  theories  were  so  radical,  it  was
seventeen  years  after  his  miraculous  outpouring  from  the  patent  office
before he was awarded the prize and she collected.

Einstein�s life and work reflected the disruption of societal certainties and
moral absolutes in the modernist atmosphere of the early twentieth century.
Imaginative  nonconformity  was 
the  air:  Picasso,  Joyce,  Freud,
in 
Stravinsky,  Schoenberg,  and  others  were  breaking  conventional  bonds.
Charging this atmosphere was a conception of the universe in which space
and  time  and  the  properties  of  particles  seemed  based  on  the  vagaries  of
observations.

Einstein, however, was not truly a relativist, even though that is how he
was interpreted by many, including some whose disdain was tinged by anti-
Semitism.  Beneath  all  of  his  theories,  including  relativity,  was  a  quest  for
invariants,  certainties,  and  absolutes.  There  was  a  harmonious  reality
underlying  the  laws  of  the  universe,  Einstein  felt,  and  the  goal  of  science
was to discover it.

His  quest  began  in  1895,  when  as  a  16-year-old  he  imagined  what  it
would  be  like  to  ride  alongside  a  light  beam.  A  decade  later  came  his
miracle  year,  described  in  the  letter  above,  which  laid  the  foundations  for
the two great advances of twentieth-century physics: relativity and quantum
theory.

A decade after that, in 1915, he wrested from nature his crowning glory,
one  of  the  most  beautiful  theories  in  all  of  science,  the  general  theory  of
relativity.  As  with  the  special  theory,  his  thinking  had  evolved  through
thought experiments. Imagine being in an enclosed elevator accelerating up
through space, he conjectured in one of them. The effects you�d feel would
be indistinguishable from the experience of gravity.

Gravity,  he  figured,  was  a  warping  of  space  and  time,  and  he  came  up
with the equations that describe how the dynamics of this curvature result
from the interplay between matter, motion, and energy. It can be described
by using another thought experiment. Picture what it would be like to roll a
bowling  ball  onto  the  two-dimensional  surface  of  a  trampoline.  Then  roll
some  billiard  balls.  They  move  toward  the  bowling  ball  not  because  it
exerts  some  mysterious  attraction  but  because  of  the  way  it  curves  the
trampoline  fabric.  Now  imagine  this  happening  in  the  four-dimensional
fabric  of  space  and  time.  Okay,  it�s  not  easy,  but  that�s  why  we�re  no
Einstein and he was.

The exact midpoint of his career came a decade after that, in 1925, and it
was a turning point. The quantum revolution he had helped to launch was
being  transformed  into  a  new  mechanics  that  was  based  on  uncertainties

and  probabilities.  He  made  his  last  great  contributions  to  quantum
mechanics that year but, simultaneously, began to resist it. He would spend
the next three decades, ending with some equations scribbled while on his
deathbed  in  1955,  stubbornly  criticizing  what  he  regarded  as  the
incompleteness of quantum mechanics while attempting to subsume it into
a unified field theory.

Both during his thirty years as a revolutionary and his subsequent thirty
years  as  a  resister,  Einstein  remained  consistent  in  his  willingness  to  be  a
serenely  amused  loner  who  was  comfortable  not  conforming.  Independent
in  his  thinking,  he  was  driven  by  an  imagination  that  broke  from  the
confines  of  conventional  wisdom.  He  was  that  odd  breed,  a  reverential
rebel,  and  he  was  guided  by  a  faith,  which  he  wore  lightly  and  with  a
twinkle in his eye, in a God who would not play dice by allowing things to
happen by chance.

Einstein�s  nonconformist  streak  was  evident  in  his  personality  and
politics as well. Although he subscribed to socialist ideals, he was too much
of  an  individualist  to  be  comfortable  with  excessive  state  control  or
centralized authority. His impudent instincts, which served him so well as a
young scientist, made him allergic to nationalism, militarism, and anything
that smacked of a herd mentality. And until Hitler caused him to revise his
geopolitical  equations,  he  was  an  instinctive  pacifist  who  celebrated
resistance to war.

His  tale  encompasses  the  vast  sweep  of  modern  science,  from  the
infinitesimal to the infinite, from the emission of photons to the expansion
of  the  cosmos.  A  century  after  his  great  triumphs,  we  are  still  living  in
Einstein�s  universe,  one  defined  on  the  macro  scale  by  his  theory  of
relativity and on the micro scale by a quantum mechanics that has proven
durable even as it remains disconcerting.

His fingerprints are all over today�s technologies. Photoelectric cells and
travel,  and  even
lasers,  nuclear  power  and 
semiconductors  all  trace  back  to  his  theories.  He  signed  the  letter  to
Franklin Roosevelt warning that it may be possible to build an atom bomb,
and the  letters  of his  famed equation  relating energy  to  mass  hover in  our
minds when we picture the resulting mushroom cloud.

fiber  optics,  space 

Einstein�s  launch  into  fame,  which  occurred  when  measurements  made
during a 1919 eclipse confirmed his prediction of how much gravity bends
light,  coincided  with,  and  contributed  to,  the  birth  of  a  new  celebrity  age.

He  became  a  scientific  supernova  and  humanist  icon,  one  of  the  most
famous faces on the planet. The public earnestly puzzled over his theories,
elevated him into a cult of genius, and canonized him as a secular saint.

If  he  did  not  have  that  electrified  halo  of  hair  and  those  piercing  eyes,
would he still have become science�s preeminent poster boy? Suppose, as a
thought experiment, that he had looked like a Max Planck or a Niels Bohr.
Would he have remained in their reputational orbit, that of a mere scientific
genius? Or would he still have made the leap into the pantheon inhabited by
Aristotle, Galileo, and Newton?2

The latter, I believe, is the case. His work had a very personal character, a
stamp  that  made  it  recognizably  his,  the  way  a  Picasso  is  recognizably  a
Picasso. He made imaginative leaps and discerned great principles through
thought  experiments  rather  than  by  methodical  inductions  based  on
experimental  data.  The  theories  that  resulted  were  at  times  astonishing,
mysterious,  and  counterintuitive,  yet  they  contained  notions  that  could
capture the popular imagination: the relativity of space and time, E=mc  2,
the bending of light beams, and the warping of space.

Adding  to  his  aura  was  his  simple  humanity.  His  inner  security  was
tempered by the humility that comes from being awed by nature. He could
be  detached  and  aloof  from  those  close  to  him,  but  toward  mankind  in
general he exuded a true kindness and gentle compassion.

Yet  for  all  of  his  popular  appeal  and  surface  accessibility,  Einstein  also
came to symbolize the perception that modern physics was something that
ordinary  laymen  could  not  comprehend,  �the  province  of  priest-like
experts,� in the words of Harvard professor Dudley Herschbach.3 It was not
always  thus.  Galileo  and  Newton  were  both  great  geniuses,  but  their
mechanical  cause-and-effect  explanation  of  the  world  was  something  that
most  thoughtful  folks  could  grasp.  In  the  eighteenth  century  of  Benjamin
Franklin and the nineteenth century of Thomas Edison, an educated person
could  feel  some  familiarity  with  science  and  even  dabble  in  it  as  an
amateur.

A  popular  feel  for  scientific  endeavors  should,  if  possible,  be  restored
given the needs of the twenty-first century. This does not mean that every
literature  major  should  take  a  watered-down  physics  course  or  that  a
corporate  lawyer  should  stay  abreast  of  quantum  mechanics.  Rather,  it
means that an appreciation for the methods of science is a useful asset for a
responsible  citizenry.  What  science  teaches  us,  very  significantly,  is  the

correlation  between  factual  evidence  and  general  theories,  something  well
illustrated in Einstein�s life.

In addition, an appreciation for the glories of science is a joyful trait for a
good  society.  It  helps  us  remain  in  touch  with  that  childlike  capacity  for
wonder,  about  such  ordinary  things  as  falling  apples  and  elevators,  that
characterizes Einstein and other great theoretical physicists.4

That  is  why  studying  Einstein  can  be  worthwhile.  Science  is  inspiring
and noble, and its pursuit an enchanting mission, as the sagas of its heroes
remind  us.  Near  the  end  of  his  life,  Einstein  was  asked  by  the  New  York
State  Education  Department  what  schools  should  emphasize.  �In  teaching
history,�  he  replied,  �there  should  be  extensive  discussion  of  personalities
who benefited mankind through independence of character and judgment.�5
Einstein fits into that category.

At  a  time  when  there  is  a  new  emphasis,  in  the  face  of  global
competition, on science and math education, we should also note the other
part of Einstein�s answer. �Critical comments by students should be taken in
a  friendly  spirit,�  he  said.  �Accumulation  of  material  should  not  stifle  the
student�s independence.� A society�s competitive advantage will come not
from how well its schools teach the multiplication and periodic tables, but
from how well they stimulate imagination and creativity.

Therein lies the key, I think, to Einstein�s brilliance and the lessons of his
life. As a young student he never did well with rote learning. And later, as a
theorist,  his  success  came  not  from  the  brute  strength  of  his  mental
processing  power  but  from  his  imagination  and  creativity.  He  could
construct complex equations, but more important, he knew that math is the
language  nature  uses  to  describe  her  wonders.  So  he  could  visualize  how
equations  were  reflected  in  realities�how  the  electromagnetic  field
equations  discovered  by  James  Clerk  Maxwell,  for  example,  would
manifest  themselves  to  a  boy  riding  alongside  a  light  beam.  As  he  once
declared, �Imagination is more important than knowledge.�6

That  approach  required  him  to  embrace  nonconformity.  �Long  live
impudence!� he exulted to the lover who would later become his wife. �It is
my  guardian  angel  in  this  world.�  Many  years  later,  when  others  thought
that his reluctance to embrace quantum mechanics showed that he had lost
his  edge,  he  lamented,  �To  punish  me  for  my  contempt  for  authority,  fate
made me an authority myself.�7

His  success  came  from  questioning  conventional  wisdom,  challenging
authority,  and  marveling  at  mysteries  that  struck  others  as  mundane.  This
led him to embrace a morality and politics based on respect for free minds,
free  spirits,  and  free  individuals.  Tyranny  repulsed  him,  and  he  saw
tolerance  not  simply  as  a  sweet  virtue  but  as  a  necessary  condition  for  a
creative society. �It is important to foster individuality,� he said, �for only
the individual can produce the new ideas.�8

This outlook made Einstein a rebel with a reverence for the harmony of
nature,  one  who  had  just  the  right  blend  of  imagination  and  wisdom  to
transform our understanding of the universe. These traits are just as vital for
this new century of globalization, in which our success will depend on our
creativity,  as  they  were  for  the  beginning  of  the  twentieth  century,  when
Einstein helped usher in the modern age.

CHAPTER TWO
CHILDHOOD
1879�1896

Maja, age 3, and Albert Einstein, 5

The Swabian

He was slow in learning how to talk. �My parents were so worried,� he
later recalled, �that they consulted a doctor.� Even after he had begun using
words, sometime after the age of 2, he developed a quirk that prompted the
family  maid  to  dub  him  �der  Depperte,�  the  dopey  one,  and  others  in  his
family to label him as �almost backwards.� Whenever he had something to
say,  he  would  try  it  out  on  himself,  whispering  it  softly  until  it  sounded
good  enough  to  pronounce  aloud.  �Every  sentence  he  uttered,�  his

 
 
 
 
worshipful younger sister recalled, �no matter how routine, he repeated to
himself softly, moving his lips.� It was all very worrying, she said. �He had
such difficulty with language that those around him feared he would never
learn.�1

His  slow  development  was  combined  with  a  cheeky  rebelliousness
toward  authority,  which  led  one  schoolmaster  to  send  him  packing  and
another to amuse history by declaring that he would never amount to much.
These traits made Albert Einstein the patron saint of distracted school kids
everywhere.2 But they also helped to make him, or so he later surmised, the
most creative scientific genius of modern times.

His cocky contempt for authority led him to question received wisdom in
ways that well-trained acolytes in the academy never contemplated. And as
for his slow verbal development, he came to believe that it allowed him to
observe with wonder the everyday phenomena that others took for granted.
�When  I  ask  myself  how  it  happened  that  I  in  particular  discovered  the
relativity  theory,  it  seemed  to  lie  in  the  following  circumstance,�  Einstein
once  explained.  �The  ordinary  adult  never  bothers  his  head  about  the
problems of space and time. These are things he has thought of as a child.
But I developed so slowly that I began to wonder about space and time only
when I was already grown up. Consequently, I probed more deeply into the
problem than an ordinary child would have.�3

Einstein�s  developmental  problems  have  probably  been  exaggerated,
perhaps  even  by  himself,  for  we  have  some  letters  from  his  adoring
grandparents  saying  that  he  was  just  as  clever  and  endearing  as  every
grandchild is. But throughout his life, Einstein had a mild form of echolalia,
causing  him  to  repeat  phrases  to  himself,  two  or  three  times,  especially  if
they  amused  him.  And  he  generally  preferred  to  think  in  pictures,  most
notably  in  famous  thought  experiments,  such  as  imagining  watching
lightning strikes from a moving train or experiencing gravity while inside a
falling  elevator.  �I  very  rarely  think  in  words  at  all,�  he  later  told  a
psychologist.  �A  thought  comes,  and  I  may  try  to  express  it  in  words
afterwards.�4

Einstein was descended, on both parents� sides, from Jewish trades-men
and peddlers who had, for at least two centuries, made modest livings in the
rural  villages  of  Swabia  in  southwestern  Germany.  With  each  generation
they had become, or at least so they thought, increasingly assimilated into
the  German  culture  that  they  loved.  Although  Jewish  by  cultural

designation and kindred instinct, they displayed scant interest in the religion
or its rituals.

Einstein regularly dismissed the role that his heritage played in shaping
who he became. �Exploration of my ancestors,� he told a friend late in life,
�leads nowhere.�5 That�s not fully true. He was blessed by being born into
an  independent-minded  and  intelligent  family  line  that  valued  education,
and  his  life  was  certainly  affected,  in  ways  both  beautiful  and  tragic,  by
membership  in  a  religious  heritage  that  had  a  distinctive  intellectual
tradition and a history of being both outsiders and wanderers. Of course, the
fact  that  he  happened  to  be  Jewish  in  Germany  in  the  early  twentieth
century  made  him  more  of  an  outsider,  and  more  of  a  wanderer,  than  he
would have preferred�but that, too, became integral to who he was and the
role he would play in world history.

Einstein�s  father,  Hermann,  was  born  in  1847  in  the  Swabian  village  of
Buchau, whose thriving Jewish community was just beginning to enjoy the
right to practice any vocation. Hermann showed �a marked inclination for
mathematics,�6  and  his  family  was  able  to  send  him  seventy-five  miles
north to Stuttgart for high school. But they could not afford to send him to a
university, most of which were closed to Jews in any event, so he returned
home to Buchau to go into trade.

A few years later, as part of the general migration of rural German Jews
into industrial centers during the late nineteenth century, Hermann and his
parents moved thirty-five miles away to the more prosperous town of Ulm,
which prophetically boasted as its motto �Ulmenses sunt mathematici,� the
people of Ulm are mathematicians.7

There  he  became  a  partner  in  a  cousin�s  featherbed  company.  He  was
�exceedingly  friendly,  mild  and  wise,�  his  son  would  recall.8  With  a
gentleness  that  blurred  into  docility,  Hermann  was  to  prove  inept  as  a
businessman  and  forever  impractical  in  financial  matters.  But  his  docility
did make him well suited to be a genial family man and good husband to a
strong-willed woman. At age 29, he married Pauline Koch, eleven years his
junior.

Pauline�s father, Julius Koch, had built a considerable fortune as a grain
dealer  and  purveyor  to  the  royal  W�rttemberg  court.  Pauline  inherited  his
practicality, but she leavened his dour disposition with a teasing wit edged
with sarcasm and a laugh that could be both infectious and wounding (traits
she  would  pass  on  to  her  son).  From  all  accounts,  the  match  between

Hermann and Pauline was a happy one, with her strong personality meshing
�in complete harmony� with her husband�s passivity.9

Their  first  child  was  born  at  11:30  a.m.  on  Friday,  March  14,  1879,  in
Ulm,  which  had  recently  joined,  along  with  the  rest  of  Swabia,  the  new
German Reich. Initially, Pauline and Hermann had planned to name the boy
Abraham, after his paternal grandfather. But they came to feel, he later said,
that the name sounded �too Jewish.�10 So they kept the initial A and named
him Albert Einstein.

Munich

In  1880,  just  a  year  after  Albert�s  birth,  Hermann�s  featherbed  business
foundered and he was persuaded to move to Munich by his brother Jakob,
who  had  opened  a  gas  and  electrical  supply  company  there.  Jakob,  the
youngest  of  five  siblings,  had  been  able  to  get  a  higher  education,  unlike
Hermann,  and  he  had  qualified  as  an  engineer.  As  they  competed  for
contracts  to  provide  generators  and  electrical  lighting  to  municipalities  in
southern  Germany,  Jakob  was  in  charge  of  the  technical  side  while
Hermann  provided  a  modicum  of  salesmanship  skills  plus,  perhaps  more
important, loans from his wife�s side of the family.11

Pauline  and  Hermann  had  a  second  and  final  child,  a  daughter,  in
November 1881, who was named Maria but throughout her life used instead
the  diminutive  Maja.  When  Albert  was  shown  his  new  sister  for  the  first
time, he was led to believe that she was like a wonderful toy that he would
enjoy. His response was to look at her and exclaim, �Yes, but where are the
wheels?�12 It may not have been the most perceptive of questions, but it did
show that during his third year his language challenges did not prevent him
from  making  some  memorable  comments.  Despite  a  few  childhood
squabbles, Maja was to become her brother�s most intimate soul mate.

The Einsteins settled into a comfortable home with mature trees and an
elegant garden in a Munich suburb for what was to be, at least through most
of Albert�s childhood, a respectable bourgeois existence. Munich had been
architecturally burnished by mad King Ludwig II (1845�1886) and boasted
a  profusion  of  churches,  art  galleries,  and  concert  halls  that  favored  the
works of resident Richard Wagner. In 1882, just after the Einsteins arrived,

 
the  city  had  about  300,000  residents,  85  percent  of  them  Catholics  and  2
percent of them Jewish, and it was the host of the first German electricity
exhibition, at which electric lights were introduced to the city streets.

Einstein�s back garden was often bustling with cousins and children. But
he  shied  from  their  boisterous  games  and  instead  �occupied  himself  with
quieter  things.�  One  governess  nicknamed  him  �Father  Bore.�  He  was
generally  a  loner,  a  tendency  he  claimed  to  cherish  throughout  his  life,
although  his  was  a  special  sort  of  detachment  that  was  interwoven  with  a
relish  for  camaraderie  and  intellectual  companionship.  �From  the  very
beginning  he  was  inclined  to  separate  himself  from  children  his  own  age
and to engage in daydreaming and meditative musing,� according to Philipp
Frank, a longtime scientific colleague.13

He  liked  to  work  on  puzzles,  erect  complex  structures  with  his  toy
building  set,  play  with  a  steam  engine  that  his  uncle  gave  him,  and  build
houses  of  cards.  According  to  Maja,  Einstein  was  able  to  construct  card
structures as high as fourteen stories. Even discounting the recollections of
a  star-struck  younger  sister,  there  was  probably  a  lot  of  truth  to  her  claim
that �persistence and tenacity were obviously already part of his character.�
He was also, at least as a young child, prone to temper tantrums. �At such
moments his face would turn completely yellow, the tip of his nose snow-
white, and he was no longer in control of himself,� Maja remembers. Once,
at  age  5,  he  grabbed  a  chair  and  threw  it  at  a  tutor,  who  fled  and  never
returned. Maja�s head became the target of various hard objects. �It takes a
sound skull,� she later joked, �to be the sister of an intellectual.� Unlike his
persistence and tenacity, he eventually outgrew his temper.14

To  use  the  language  of  psychologists,  the  young  Einstein�s  ability  to
systemize (identify the laws that govern a system) was far greater than his
ability to empathize (sense and care about what other humans are feeling),
which have led some to ask if he might have exhibited mild symptoms of
some  developmental  disorder.15  However,  it  is  important  to  note  that,
despite his aloof and occasionally rebellious manner, he did have the ability
to make close friends and to empathize both with colleagues and humanity
in general.

The  great  awakenings  that  happen  in  childhood  are  usually  lost  to
memory. But for Einstein, an experience occurred when he was 4 or 5 that
would alter his life and be etched forever in his mind�and in the history of
science.

He  was  sick  in  bed  one  day,  and  his  father  brought  him  a  compass.  He
later recalled being so excited as he examined its mysterious powers that he
trembled  and  grew  cold.  The  fact  that  the  magnetic  needle  behaved  as  if
influenced  by  some  hidden  force  field,  rather  than  through  the  more
familiar mechanical method involving touch or contact, produced a sense of
wonder that motivated him throughout his life. �I can still remember�or at
least  I  believe  I  can  remember�that  this  experience  made  a  deep  and
lasting  impression  on  me,�  he  wrote  on  one  of  the  many  occasions  he
recounted  the  incident.  �Something  deeply  hidden  had  to  be  behind
things.�16

�It�s  an  iconic  story,�  Dennis  Overbye  noted  in  Einstein  in  Love,�the
young  boy  trembling  to  the  invisible  order  behind  chaotic  reality.�  It  has
been  told  in  the  movie  IQ,  in  which  Einstein,  played  by  Walter  Matthau,
wears the compass around his neck, and it is the focus of a children�s book,
Rescuing Albert�s Compass, by Shulamith Oppenheim, whose father-in-law
heard the tale from Einstein in 1911.17

After  being  mesmerized  by  the  compass  needle�s  fealty  to  an  unseen
field, Einstein would develop a lifelong devotion to field theories as a way
to  describe  nature.  Field  theories  use  mathematical  quantities,  such  as
numbers or vectors or tensors, to describe how the conditions at any point
in space will affect matter or another field. For example, in a gravitational
or  an  electromagnetic  field  there  are  forces  that  could  act  on  a  particle  at
any point, and the equations of a field theory describe how these change as
one moves through the region. The first paragraph of his great 1905 paper
on special relativity begins with a consideration of the effects of electrical
and  magnetic  fields;  his  theory  of  general  relativity  is  based  on  equations
that  describe  a  gravitational  field;  and  at  the  very  end  of  his  life  he  was
doggedly scribbling further field equations in the hope that they would form
the basis for a theory of everything. As the science historian Gerald Holton
has noted, Einstein regarded �the classical concept of the field the greatest
contribution to the scientific spirit.�18

His mother, an accomplished pianist, also gave him a gift at around the
same  time,  one  that  likewise  would  last  throughout  his  life.  She  arranged
for him to take violin lessons. At first he chafed at the mechanical discipline
of  the  instruction.  But  after  being  exposed  to  Mozart�s  sonatas,  music
became both magical and emotional to him. �I believe that love is a better
teacher than a sense of duty,� he said, �at least for me.�19

Soon  he  was  playing  Mozart  duets,  with  his  mother  accompanying  him
on  the  piano.  �Mozart�s  music  is  so  pure  and  beautiful  that  I  see  it  as  a
reflection of the inner beauty of the universe itself,� he later told a friend.
�Of  course,�  he  added  in  a  remark  that  reflected  his  view  of  math  and
physics  as  well  as  of  Mozart,  �like  all  great  beauty,  his  music  was  pure
simplicity.�20

Music  was  no  mere  diversion.  On  the  contrary,  it  helped  him  think.
�Whenever  he  felt  that  he  had  come  to  the  end  of  the  road  or  faced  a
difficult challenge  in  his  work,�  said  his  son Hans  Albert, �he would take
refuge  in  music  and  that  would  solve  all  his  difficulties.�  The  violin  thus
proved  useful  during  the  years  he  lived  alone  in  Berlin,  wrestling  with
general  relativity.  �He  would  often  play  his  violin  in  his  kitchen  late  at
night,  improvising  melodies  while  he  pondered  complicated  problems,�  a
friend  recalled.  �Then,  suddenly,  in  the  middle  of  playing,  he  would
announce  excitedly,  �I�ve  got  it!�  As  if  by  inspiration,  the  answer  to  the
problem would have come to him in the midst of music.�21

His appreciation for music, and especially for Mozart, may have reflected
his  feel for  the  harmony of the  universe. As  Alexander  Moszkowski,  who
wrote  a  biography  of  Einstein  in  1920  based  on  conversations  with  him,
noted, �Music, Nature, and God became intermingled in him in a complex
of feeling, a moral unity, the trace of which never vanished.�22

Throughout  his  life,  Albert  Einstein  would  retain  the  intuition  and  the
awe of a child. He never lost his sense of wonder at the magic of nature�s
phenomena�magnetic  fields,  gravity,  inertia,  acceleration,  light  beams�
which grown-ups find so commonplace. He retained the ability to hold two
thoughts  in  his  mind  simultaneously,  to  be  puzzled  when  they  conflicted,
and  to  marvel  when  he  could  smell  an  underlying  unity.  �People  like  you
and me never grow old,� he wrote a friend later in life. �We never cease to
stand  like  curious  children  before  the  great  mystery  into  which  we  were
born.�23

School

In his later years, Einstein would tell an old joke about an agnostic uncle,
who  was  the  only  member  of  his  family  who  went  to  synagogue.  When

 
asked why he did so, the uncle would respond, �Ah, but you never know.�
Einstein�s parents, on the other hand, were �entirely irreligious� and felt no
compulsion  to  hedge  their  bets.  They  did  not  keep  kosher  or  attend
to  Jewish  rituals  as  �ancient
synagogue,  and  his  father  referred 
superstitions.�24

Consequently, when Albert turned 6 and had to go to school, his parents
did not care that there was no Jewish one near their home. Instead he went
to the large Catholic school in their neighborhood, the Petersschule. As the
only Jew among the seventy students in his class, Einstein took the standard
course in Catholic religion and ended up enjoying it immensely. Indeed, he
did  so  well  in  his  Catholic  studies  that  he  helped  his  classmates  with
theirs.25

One  day  his  teacher  brought  a  large  nail  to  the  class.�The  nails  with
which  Jesus  was  nailed  to  the  cross  looked  like  this,�  he  said.26
Nevertheless,  Einstein  later  said  that  he  felt  no  discrimination  from  the
teachers.  �The  teachers  were  liberal  and  made  no  distinction  based  on
denominations,�  he  wrote.  His  fellow  students,  however,  were  a  different
matter.  �Among  the  children  at  the  elementary  school,  anti-Semitism  was
prevalent,� he recalled.

Being  taunted  on  his  walks  to  and  from  school  based  on  �racial
characteristics  about  which  the  children  were  strangely  aware�  helped
reinforce  the  sense  of  being  an  outsider,  which  would  stay  with  him  his
entire life. �Physical attacks and insults on the way home from school were
frequent,  but  for  the  most  part  not  too  vicious.  Nevertheless,  they  were
sufficient  to  consolidate,  even  in  a  child,  a  lively  sense  of  being  an
outsider.�27

When he turned 9, Einstein moved up to a high school near the center of
Munich,  the  Luitpold  Gymnasium,  which  was  known  as  an  enlightened
institution that emphasized math and science as well as Latin and Greek. In
addition,  the  school  supplied  a  teacher  to  provide  religious  instruction  for
him and other Jews.

Despite his parents� secularism, or perhaps because of it, Einstein rather
suddenly developed a passionate zeal for Judaism. �He was so fervent in his
feelings  that,  on  his  own,  he  observed  Jewish  religious  strictures  in  every
detail,�  his  sister  recalled.  He  ate  no  pork,  kept  kosher  dietary  laws,  and
obeyed the strictures of the Sabbath, all rather difficult to do when the rest
of his family had a lack of interest bordering on disdain for such displays.

He  even  composed  his  own  hymns  for  the  glorification  of  God,  which  he
sang to himself as he walked home from school.28

One widely held belief about Einstein is that he failed math as a student,
an  assertion  that  is  made,  often  accompanied  by  the  phrase  �as  everyone
knows,� by scores of books and thousands of websites designed to reassure
underachieving students. It even made it into the famous �Ripley�s Believe
It or Not!� newspaper column.

Alas, Einstein�s childhood offers history many savory ironies, but this is
not one of them. In 1935, a rabbi in Princeton showed him a clipping of the
Ripley�s  column  with  the  headline  �Greatest  Living  Mathematician  Failed
in  Mathematics.�  Einstein  laughed.  �I  never  failed  in  mathematics,�  he
replied,  correctly.  �Before  I  was  fifteen  I  had  mastered  differential  and
integral calculus.�29

In  fact,  he  was  a  wonderful  student,  at  least  intellectually.  In  primary
school, he was at the top of his class. �Yesterday Albert got his grades,� his
mother  reported  to  an  aunt  when  he  was  7.  �Once  again  he  was  ranked
first.� At the gymnasium, he disliked the mechanical learning of languages
such as Latin and Greek, a problem exacerbated by what he later said was
his �bad memory for words and texts.� But even in these courses, Einstein
consistently got top grades. Years later, when Einstein celebrated his fiftieth
birthday and there were stories about how poorly the great genius had fared
at the gymnasium, the school�s current principal made a point of publishing
a letter revealing how good his grades actually were.30

As  for  math,  far  from  being  a  failure,  he  was  �far  above  the  school
requirements.� By age 12, his sister recalled, �he already had a predilection
for solving complicated problems in applied arithmetic,� and he decided to
see if he could jump ahead by learning geometry and algebra on his own.
His  parents  bought  him  the  textbooks  in  advance  so  that  he  could  master
them over summer vacation. Not only did he learn the proofs in the books,
he tackled the new theories by trying to prove them on his own. �Play and
playmates  were  forgotten,�  she  noted.  �For  days  on  end  he  sat  alone,
immersed  in  the  search  for  a  solution,  not  giving  up  before  he  had  found
it.�31

His  uncle  Jakob  Einstein,  the  engineer,  introduced  him  to  the  joys  of
algebra. �It�s a merry science,� he explained. �When the animal that we are
hunting  cannot  be  caught,  we  call  it  X  temporarily  and  continue  to  hunt
until  it  is  bagged.�  He  went  on  to  give  the  boy  even  more  difficult

challenges,  Maja  recalled,  �with  good-natured  doubts  about  his  ability  to
solve  them.�  When  Einstein  triumphed,  as  he  invariably  did,  he  �was
overcome with great happiness and was already then aware of the direction
in which his talents were leading him.�

Among the concepts that Uncle Jakob threw at him was the Pythagorean
theorem (the square of the lengths of the legs of a right triangle add up to
the square of the length of the hypotenuse). �After much effort I succeeded
in  �proving�  this  theorem  on  the  basis  of  the  similarity  of  triangles,�
Einstein recalled. Once again he was thinking in pictures. �It seemed to me
�evident� that the relations of the sides of the right-angled triangles would
have to be completely determined by one of the acute angles.�32

Maja,  with  the  pride  of  a  younger  sister,  called  Einstein�s  Pythagorean
proof  �an  entirely  original  new  one.�  Although  perhaps  new  to  him,  it  is
hard  to  imagine  that  Einstein�s  approach,  which  was  surely  similar  to  the
standard ones based on the proportionality of the sides of similar triangles,
was  completely  original.  Nevertheless,  it  did  show  Einstein�s  youthful
appreciation that elegant theorems can be derived from simple axioms�and
the fact that he was in little danger of failing math. �As a boy of 12, I was
thrilled  to  see  that  it  was  possible  to  find  out  truth  by  reasoning  alone,
without the help of any outside experience,� he told a reporter from a high
school  newspaper  in  Princeton  years  later.  �I  became  more  and  more
convinced  that  nature  could  be  understood  as  a  relatively  simple
mathematical structure.�33

Einstein�s  greatest  intellectual  stimulation  came  from  a  poor  medical
student who used to dine with his family once a week. It was an old Jewish
custom to take in a needy religious scholar to share the Sabbath meal; the
Einsteins  modified  the  tradition  by  hosting  instead  a  medical  student  on
Thursdays. His name was Max Talmud (later changed to Talmey, when he
immigrated to the United States), and he began his weekly visits when he
was  21  and  Einstein  was  10.  �He  was  a  pretty,  dark-haired  boy,�
remembered Talmud. �In all those years, I never saw him reading any light
literature.  Nor  did  I  ever  see  him  in  the  company  of  schoolmates  or  other
boys his age.�34

Talmud brought him science books, including a popular illustrated series
called  People�s  Books  on  Natural  Science,  �a  work  which  I  read  with
breathless  attention,�  said  Einstein.  The  twenty-one  little  volumes  were
written by Aaron Bernstein, who stressed the interrelations between biology

and physics, and he reported in great detail the scientific experiments being
done at the time, especially in Germany.35

In the opening section of the first volume, Bernstein dealt with the speed
of  light,  a  topic  that  obviously  fascinated  him.  Indeed,  he  returned  to  it
repeatedly in his subsequent volumes, including eleven essays on the topic
in volume 8. Judging from the thought experiments that Einstein later used
in  creating  his  theory  of  relativity,  Bernstein�s  books  appear  to  have  been
influential.

For  example,  Bernstein  asked  readers  to  imagine  being  on  a  speeding
train. If a bullet is shot through the window, it would seem that it was shot
at an angle, because the train would have moved between the time the bullet
entered  one  window  and  exited  the  window  on  the  other  side.  Likewise,
because of the speed of the earth through space, the same must be true of
light going through a telescope. What was amazing, said Bernstein, was that
experiments  showed  the  same  effect  no  matter  how  fast  the  source  of  the
light was moving. In a sentence that, because of its relation to what Einstein
would  later  famously  conclude,  seems  to  have  made  an  impression,
Bernstein  declared,  �Since  each  kind  of  light  proves  to  be  of  exactly  the
same  speed,  the  law  of  the  speed  of  light  can  well  be  called  the  most
general of all of nature�s laws.�

In another volume, Bernstein took his young readers on an imaginary trip
through  space.  The  mode  of  transport  was  the  wave  of  an  electric  signal.
His  books  celebrated  the  joyful  wonders  of  scientific  investigation  and
included  such  exuberant  passages  as  this  one  written  about  the  successful
prediction  of  the  location  of  the  new  planet  Uranus:  �Praised  be  this
science!  Praised  be  the  men  who  do  it!  And  praised  be  the  human  mind,
which sees more sharply than does the human eye.�36

Bernstein  was,  as  Einstein  would  later  be,  eager  to  tie  together  all  of
nature�s  forces.  For  example,  after  discussing  how  all  electromagnetic
phenomena, such as light, could be considered waves, he speculated that the
same may be true for gravity. A unity and simplicity, Bernstein wrote, lay
beneath  all  the  concepts  applied  by  our  perceptions.  Truth  in  science
consisted  in  discovering  theories  that  described  this  underlying  reality.
Einstein  later  recalled  the  revelation,  and  the  realist  attitude,  that  this
instilled  in  him  as  a  young  boy:  �Out  yonder  there  was  this  huge  world,
which exists independently of us human beings and which stands before us
like a great, eternal riddle.�37

Years later, when they met in New York during Einstein�s first visit there,
Talmud asked what he thought, in retrospect, of Bernstein�s work. �A very
good  book,�  he  said.  �It  has  exerted  a  great  influence  on  my  whole
development.�38

Talmud  also  helped  Einstein  continue  to  explore  the  wonders  of
mathematics  by  giving  him  a  textbook  on  geometry  two  years  before  he
was scheduled to learn that subject in school. Later, Einstein would refer to
it as �the sacred little geometry book� and speak of it with awe: �Here were
assertions, as for example the intersection of the three altitudes of a triangle
in  one point, which�though  by no  means  evident�could nevertheless be
proved  with  such  certainty  that  any  doubt  appeared  to  be  out  of  the
question. This lucidity and certainty made an indescribable impression upon
me.� Years later, in a lecture at Oxford, Einstein noted, �If Euclid failed to
kindle your youthful enthusiasm, then you were not born to be a scientific
thinker.�39

When Talmud arrived each Thursday, Einstein delighted in showing him
the  problems  he  had  solved  that  week.  Initially,  Talmud  was  able  to  help
him,  but  he  was  soon  surpassed  by  his  pupil.  �After  a  short  time,  a  few
months,  he  had  worked  through  the  whole  book,�  Talmud  recalled.  �He
thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics . . . Soon the flight of his
mathematical genius was so high that I could no longer follow.�40

So  the  awed  medical  student  moved  on  to  introducing  Einstein  to
philosophy.  �I  recommended  Kant  to  him,�  he  recalled.  �At  that  time  he
thirteen  years  old,  yet  Kant�s  works,
was  still  a  child,  only 
incomprehensible  to  ordinary  mortals,  seemed  to  be  clear  to  him.�  Kant
became,  for  a  while,  Einstein�s  favorite  philosopher,  and  his  Critique  of
Pure  Reason  eventually  led  him  to  delve  also  into  David  Hume,  Ernst
Mach, and the issue of what can be known about reality.

Einstein�s  exposure  to  science  produced  a  sudden  reaction  against
religion at age 12, just as he would have been readying for a bar mitzvah.
Bernstein,  in  his  popular  science  volumes,  had  reconciled  science  with
religious inclination. As he put it, �The religious inclination lies in the dim
consciousness  that dwells  in  humans  that all nature, including  the  humans
in it, is in no way an accidental game, but a work of lawfulness, that there is
a fundamental cause of all existence.�

Einstein would later come close to these sentiments. But at the time, his
leap  away  from  faith  was  a  radical  one.  �Through  the  reading  of  popular

scientific  books,  I  soon  reached  the  conviction  that  much  in  the  stories  of
the Bible could not be true. The consequence was a positively fanatic orgy
of freethinking coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being
deceived by the state through lies; it was a crushing impression.�41

As  a  result,  Einstein  avoided  religious  rituals  for  the  rest  of  his  life.
�There arose in Einstein an aversion to the orthodox practice of the Jewish
or any traditional religion, as well as to attendance at religious services, and
this  he  has  never  lost,�  his  friend  Philipp  Frank  later  noted.  He  did,
however, retain from his childhood religious phase a profound reverence for
the  harmony  and  beauty  of  what  he  called  the  mind  of  God  as  it  was
expressed in the creation of the universe and its laws.42

Einstein�s rebellion against religious dogma had a profound effect on his
general outlook toward received wisdom. It inculcated an allergic reaction
against  all  forms  of  dogma  and  authority,  which  was  to  affect  both  his
politics and his science. �Suspicion against every kind of authority grew out
of this experience, an attitude which has never again left me,� he later said.
Indeed,  it  was  this  comfort  with  being  a  nonconformist  that  would  define
both his science and his social thinking for the rest of his life.

He would later be able to pull off this contrariness with a grace that was
generally endearing, once he was accepted as a genius. But it did not play
so well when he was merely a sassy student at a Munich gymnasium. �He
was  very  uncomfortable  in  school,�  according  to  his  sister.  He  found  the
style  of 
impatience  with  questioning�to  be
repugnant.  �The  military  tone  of  the  school,  the  systematic  training  in  the
worship of authority that was supposed to accustom pupils at an early age to
military discipline, was particularly unpleasant.�43

teaching�rote  drills, 

Even in Munich, where the Bavarian spirit engendered a less regimented
approach  to  life,  this Prussian glorification  of the  military  had taken  hold,
and  many  of  the  children  loved  to  play  at  being  soldiers.  When  troops
would come by, accompanied by fifes and drums, kids would pour into the
streets to join the parade and march in lockstep. But not Einstein. Watching
such a display once, he began to cry. �When I grow up, I don�t want to be
one of those poor people,� he told his parents. As Einstein later explained,
�When a person can take pleasure in marching in step to a piece of music it
is enough to make me despise him. He has been given his big brain only by
mistake.�44

The opposition he felt to all types of regimentation made his education at
the  Munich  gymnasium  increasingly  irksome  and  contentious.  The
mechanical learning there, he complained, �seemed very much akin to the
methods of the Prussian army, where a mechanical discipline was achieved
by repeated execution of meaningless orders.� In later years, he would liken
his  teachers  to  members  of  the  military.  �The  teachers  at  the  elementary
school seemed to me like drill sergeants,� he said, �and the teachers at the
gymnasium like lieutenants.�

He  once  asked  C.  P.  Snow,  the  British  writer  and  scientist,  whether  he
was  familiar with  the  German  word Zwang.  Snow  allowed  that  he  was; it
meant  constraint,  compulsion,  obligation,  coercion.  Why?  In  his  Munich
school, Einstein answered, he had made his first strike against Zwang, and it
had helped define him ever since.45

Skepticism and a resistance to received wisdom became a hallmark of his
life.  As  he  proclaimed  in  a  letter  to  a  fatherly  friend  in  1901,  �A  foolish
faith in authority is the worst enemy of truth.�46

Throughout  the  six  decades  of  his  scientific  career,  whether  leading  the
quantum revolution or later resisting it, this attitude helped shape Einstein�s
work. �His early suspicion of authority, which never wholly left him, was to
prove  of  decisive  importance,�  said  Banesh  Hoffmann,  who  was  a
collaborator of Einstein�s in his later years. �Without it he would not have
been able to develop the powerful independence of mind that gave him the
courage to challenge established scientific beliefs and thereby revolutionize
physics.�47

This  contempt  for  authority  did  not  endear  him  to  the  German
�lieutenants� who taught him at his school. As a result, one of his teachers
proclaimed that his insolence made him unwelcome in class. When Einstein
insisted that he had committed no offense, the teacher replied, �Yes, that is
true, but  you  sit there in  the  back row  and smile, and your mere presence
here spoils the respect of the class for me.�48

Einstein�s discomfort spiraled toward depression, perhaps even close to a
nervous  breakdown,  when  his  father�s  business  suffered  a  sudden  reversal
of  fortune.  The  collapse  was  a  precipitous  one.  During  most  of  Einstein�s
school years, the Einstein brothers� company had been a success. In 1885, it
had  two  hundred  employees  and  provided  the  first  electrical  lights  for
Munich�s Oktoberfest. Over the next few years, it won the contract to wire
the  community  of  Schwabing,  a  Munich  suburb  of  ten  thousand  people,

using  gas  motors  to  drive  twin  dynamos  that  the  Einsteins  had  designed.
Jakob  Einstein  received  six  patents  for  improvements  in  arc  lamps,
automatic circuit breakers, and electric meters. The company was poised to
rival Siemens and other power companies then flourishing. To raise capital,
the  brothers mortgaged  their  homes,  borrowed more than  60,000  marks at
10 percent interest, and went deeply in debt.49

But in 1894, when Einstein was 15, the company went bust after it lost
competitions  to  light  the  central  part  of  Munich  and  other  locations.  His
parents  and  sister,  along  with  Uncle  Jakob,  moved  to  northern  Italy�first
Milan  and  then  the  nearby  town  of  Pavia�where  the  company�s  Italian
partners  thought  there  would  be  more  fertile  territory  for  a  smaller  firm.
Their  elegant  home  was  torn  down  by  a  developer  to  build  an  apartment
block. Einstein was left behind in Munich, at the house of a distant relative,
to finish his final three years of school.

It  is  not  quite  clear  whether  Einstein,  in  that  sad  autumn  of  1894,  was
actually  forced  to  leave  the  Luitpold  Gymnasium  or  was  merely  politely
encouraged  to  leave.  Years  later,  he  recalled  that  the  teacher  who  had
declared that his �presence spoils the respect of the class for me� had gone
on to �express the wish that I leave the school.� An early book by a member
of  his  family  said  that  it  was  his  own  decision.  �Albert  increasingly
resolved not to remain in Munich, and he worked out a plan.�

That plan involved getting a letter from the family doctor, Max Talmud�s
older brother, who certified that he was suffering from nervous exhaustion.
He used this to justify leaving the school at Christmas vacation in 1894 and
not returning. Instead, he took a train across the Alps to Italy and informed
his �alarmed� parents that he was never going back to Germany. Instead, he
promised,  he  would  study  on  his  own  and  attempt  to  gain  admission  to  a
technical college in Zurich the following autumn.

There  was  perhaps  one  other  factor  in  his  decision  to  leave  Germany.
Had  he  remained  there  until  he  was  17,  just  over  a  year  away,  he  would
have  been  required  to  join  the  army,  a  prospect  that  his  sister  said  �he
contemplated with dread.� So, in addition to announcing that he would not
go back to Munich, he would soon ask for his father�s help in renouncing
his German citizenship.50

Aarau

Einstein spent the spring and summer of 1895 living with his parents in
their Pavia apartment and helping at the family firm. In the process, he was
able  to  get  a  good  feel  for  the  workings  of  magnets,  coils,  and  generated
electricity.  Einstein�s  work  impressed  his  family.  On  one  occasion,  Uncle
Jakob was having problems with some calculations for a new machine, so
Einstein  went  to  work  on  it.  �After  my  assistant  engineer  and  I  had  been
racking our brain for days, that young sprig had got the whole thing in just
fifteen minutes,� Jakob reported to a friend. �You will hear of him yet.�51

With  his  love  of  the  sublime  solitude  found  in  the  mountains,  Einstein
hiked  for  days  in  the  Alps  and  Apennines,  including  an  excursion  from
Pavia  to  Genoa  to  see  his  mother�s  brother  Julius  Koch.  Wherever  he
traveled in northern Italy, he was delighted by the non-Germanic grace and
�delicacy�  of  the  people.  Their  �naturalness�  was  a  contrast  to  the
�spiritually broken and mechanically obedient automatons� of Germany, his
sister recalled.

Einstein had promised his family that he would study on his own to get
into  the  local  technical  college,  the  Zurich  Polytechnic.* So  he bought  all
three volumes of Jules Violle�s advanced physics text and copiously noted
his ideas in the margins. His work habits showed his ability to concentrate,
his sister recalled. �Even in a large, quite noisy group, he could withdraw to
the  sofa,  take  pen  and  paper  in  hand,  set  the  inkstand  precariously  on  the
armrest, and lose himself so completely in a problem that the conversation
of many voices stimulated rather than disturbed him.�52

That  summer,  at  age  16,  he  wrote  his  first  essay  on  theoretical  physics,
which he titled �On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic
Field.�  The  topic  was  important,  for  the  notion  of  the  ether  would  play  a
critical  role  in  Einstein�s  career.  At  the  time,  scientists  conceived  of  light
simply  as  a  wave,  and  so  they  assumed  that  the  universe  must  contain  an
all-pervasive  yet  unseen  substance  that  was  doing  the  rippling  and  thus
propagating the waves, just as water was the medium rippling up and down
and thus propagating the waves in an ocean. They dubbed this the ether, and
Einstein (at least for the time being) went along with the assumption. As he
put it in his essay, �An electric current sets the surrounding ether in a kind
of momentary motion.�

The  fourteen-paragraph  handwritten  paper  echoed  Violle�s  textbook  as
well as some of the reports in the popular science magazines about Heinrich

 
Hertz�s recent discoveries about electromagnetic waves. In it, Einstein made
suggestions for experiments that could explain �the magnetic field formed
around an electric current.� This would be interesting, he argued, �because
the exploration of the elastic state of the ether in this case would permit us a
look into the enigmatic nature of electric current.�

The  high  school  dropout  freely  admitted  that  he  was  merely  making  a
few  suggestions  without  knowing  where  they  might  lead.  �As  I  was
completely  lacking  in  materials  that  would  have  enabled  me  to  delve  into
the subject more deeply than by merely meditating about it, I beg you not to
interpret this circumstance as a mark of superficiality,� he wrote.53

He sent the paper to his uncle Caesar Koch, a merchant in Belgium, who
was one of his favorite relatives and occasionally a financial patron. �It is
rather na�ve and imperfect, as might be expected from such a young fellow
like myself,� Einstein confessed with a pretense of humility. He added that
his  goal  was  to  enroll  the  following  fall  at  the  Zurich  Polytechnic,  but  he
was concerned that he was younger than the age requirement. �I should be
at least two years older.�54

To help him get around the age requirement, a family friend wrote to the
director of the Polytechnic, asking for an exception. The tone of the letter
can  be  gleaned  from  the  director�s  response,  which  expressed  skepticism
about admitting this �so-called �child prodigy.� � Nevertheless, Einstein was
granted permission to take the entrance exam, and he boarded the train for
Zurich in October 1895 �with a sense of well-founded diffidence.�

Not  surprisingly,  he  easily  passed  the  section  of  the  exam  in  math  and
science. But he failed to pass the general section, which included sections
on literature, French, zoology, botany, and politics. The Polytechnic�s head
physics  professor,  Heinrich  Weber,  suggested  that  Einstein  stay  in  Zurich
and  audit  his  classes.  Instead,  Einstein  decided,  on  the  advice  of  the
college�s  director,  to  spend  a  year  preparing  at  the  cantonal  school  in  the
village of Aarau, twenty-five miles to the west.55

It  was  a  perfect  school  for  Einstein.  The  teaching  was  based  on  the
philosophy of a Swiss educational reformer of the early nineteenth century,
Johann  Heinrich  Pestalozzi,  who  believed  in  encouraging  students  to
visualize images. He also thought it important to nurture the �inner dignity�
and  individuality  of  each  child.  Students  should  be  allowed  to  reach  their
own conclusions, Pestalozzi preached, by using a series of steps that began
with  hands-on  observations  and  then  proceeded  to  intuitions,  conceptual

thinking,  and  visual  imagery.56  It  was  even  possible  to  learn�and  truly
understand�the  laws  of  math  and  physics  that  way.  Rote  drills,
memorization, and force-fed facts were avoided.

Einstein  loved  Aarau.  �Pupils  were  treated  individually,�  his  sister
recalled,  �more  emphasis  was  placed  on  independent  thought  than  on
punditry, and young people saw the teacher not as a figure of authority, but,
alongside the student, a man of distinct personality.� It was the opposite of
the  German  education  that  Einstein  had  hated.  �When  compared  to  six
years� schooling at a German authoritarian gymnasium,� Einstein later said,
�it made me clearly realize how much superior an education based on free
action and personal responsibility is to one relying on outward authority.�57
The  visual  understanding  of  concepts,  as  stressed  by  Pestalozzi  and  his
followers  in  Aarau,  became  a  significant  aspect  of  Einstein�s  genius.
�Visual understanding is the essential and only true means of teaching how
to  judge  things  correctly,�  Pestalozzi  wrote,  and  �the  learning  of  numbers
and language must be definitely subordinated.�58

Not  surprisingly,  it  was  at  this  school  that  Einstein  first  engaged  in  the
visualized  thought  experiment  that  would  help  make  him  the  greatest
scientific genius of his time: he tried to picture what it would be like to ride
alongside  a  light  beam.  �In  Aarau  I  made  my  first  rather  childish
experiments in thinking that had a direct bearing on the Special Theory,� he
later told a friend. �If a person could run after a light wave with the same
speed  as  light,  you  would  have  a  wave  arrangement  which  could  be
completely independent of time. Of course, such a thing is impossible.�59

This  type  of  visualized  thought  experiments�Gedankenexperiment�
became a hallmark of Einstein�s career. Over the years, he would picture in
his  mind  such  things  as  lightning  strikes  and  moving  trains,  accelerating
elevators  and  falling  painters,  two-dimensional  blind  beetles  crawling  on
curved branches, as well as a variety of contraptions designed to pinpoint,
at least in theory, the location and velocity of speeding electrons.

While a student in Aarau, Einstein boarded with a wonderful family, the
Wintelers,  whose  members  would  long  remain  entwined  in  his  life.  There
was  Jost  Winteler,  who  taught  history  and  Greek  at  the  school;  his  wife,
Rosa,  soon  known  to  Einstein  as  Mamerl,  or  Mama;  and  their  seven
children.  Their  daughter  Marie  would  become  Einstein�s  first  girlfriend.
Another  daughter,  Anna,  would  marry  Einstein�s  best  friend,  Michele
Besso. And their son Paul would marry Einstein�s beloved sister, Maja.

�Papa�  Jost  Winteler  was  a  liberal  who  shared  Einstein�s  allergy  to
German  militarism  and  to  nationalism  in  general.  His  edgy  honesty  and
political  idealism  helped  to  shape  Einstein�s  social  philosophy.  Like  his
mentor,  Einstein  would  become  a  supporter  of  world  federalism,
internationalism,  pacifism,  and  democratic  socialism,  with  a  strong
devotion to individual liberty and freedom of expression.

More  important,  in  the  warm  embrace  of  the  Winteler  family,  Einstein
became more secure and personable. Even though he still fancied himself a
loner,  the  Wintelers  helped  him  flower  emotionally  and  open  himself  to
intimacy. �He had a great sense of humor and at times could laugh heartily,�
recalled  daughter  Anna.  In  the  evenings  he  would  sometimes  study,  �but
more often he would sit with the family around the table.�60

Einstein  had  developed  into  a  head-turning  teenager  who  possessed,  in
the words of one woman who knew him, �masculine good looks of the type
that  played  havoc  at  the  turn  of  the  century.�  He  had  wavy  dark  hair,
expressive eyes, a high forehead, and jaunty demeanor. �The lower half of
his face might have belonged to a sensualist who found plenty of reasons to
love life.�

One of his schoolmates, Hans Byland, later wrote a striking description
of �the impudent Swabian� who made such a lasting impression. �Sure of
himself,  his  gray  felt  hat  pushed  back  on  his  thick,  black  hair,  he  strode
energetically  up  and  down  in  the  rapid,  I  might  say  crazy,  tempo  of  a
restless  spirit  which  carries  a  whole  world  in  itself.  Nothing  escaped  the
sharp  gaze  of  the  large  bright  brown  eyes.  Whoever  approached  him  was
captivated by his superior personality. A mocking curl of his fleshy mouth
with its protruding lower lip did not encourage Philistines to fraternize with
him.�

Most  notably,  Byland  added,  young  Einstein  had  a  sassy,  sometimes
intimidating wit. �He confronted the world spirit as a laughing philosopher,
and his witty sarcasm mercilessly castigated all vanity and artificiality.�61

Einstein  fell  in  love  with  Marie Winteler at  the  end of 1895, just a few
months after he moved in with her parents. She had just completed teacher
training  college  and  was  living  at  home  while  waiting  to  take  a  job  in  a
nearby  village.  She  was  just  turning  18,  he  was  still  16.  The  romance
thrilled  both  families.  Albert  and  Marie  sent  New  Year�s  greetings  to  his
mother; she replied warmly, �Your little letter, dear Miss Marie, brought me
immense joy.�62

The following April, when he was back home in Pavia for spring break,

Einstein wrote Marie his first known love letter:

Beloved sweetheart!

Many, many thanks sweetheart for your charming little letter, which
made  me  endlessly  happy.  It  was  so  wonderful  to  be  able  to  press  to
one�s  heart  such  a  bit  of  paper  which  two  so  dear  little  eyes  have
lovingly beheld and on which the dainty little hands have charmingly
glided back and forth. I was now made to realize, my little angel, the
meaning of homesickness and pining. But love brings much happiness
�much more so than pining brings pain . . .

My mother has also taken you to her heart, even though she does not
know you; I only let her read two of your charming little letters. And
she always laughs at me because I am no longer attracted to the girls
who  were  supposed  to  have  enchanted  me  so  much  in  the  past.  You
mean more to my soul than the whole world did before.

To which his mother penned a postscript: �Without having read this letter, I
send you cordial greetings!�63

Although  he  enjoyed  the  school  in  Aarau,  Einstein  turned  out  to  be  an
uneven  student.  His  admission  report  noted  that  he  needed  to  do  remedial
work  in  chemistry  and  had  �great  gaps�  in  his  knowledge  of  French.  By
midyear, he still was required to �continue with private lessons in French &
chemistry,�  and  �the  protest  in  French  remains  in  effect.�  His  father  was
sanguine when Jost Winteler sent him the midyear report. �Not all its parts
fulfill my wishes and expectations,� he wrote, �but with Albert I got used to
finding mediocre grades along with very good ones, and I am therefore not
disconsolate about them.�64

Music continued to be a passion. There were nine violinists in his class,
and  their  teacher  noted  that  they  suffered  from  �some  stiffness  in  bowing
technique  here  and  there.�  But  Einstein  was  singled  out  for  praise:  �One
student,  by  the  name  of  Einstein,  even  sparkled  by  rendering  an  adagio
from  a  Beethoven  sonata  with  deep  understanding.�  At  a  concert  in  the
local church, Einstein was chosen to play first violin in a piece by Bach. His
�enchanting tone and incomparable rhythm� awed the second violinist, who

 
asked, �Do you count the beats?� Einstein replied, �Heavens no, it�s in my
blood.�

His  classmate  Byland  recalled  Einstein  playing  a  Mozart  sonata  with
such  passion��What  fire  there  was  in  his  playing!��that  it  seemed  like
hearing  the  composer  for  the  first  time.  Listening  to  him,  Byland  realized
that  Einstein�s  wisecracking,  sarcastic  exterior  was  a  shell  around  a  softer
inner  soul.  �He  was  one  of  those  split  personalities  who  know  how  to
protect, with a prickly exterior, the delicate realm of their intense personal
life.�65

Einstein�s  contempt  for  Germany�s  authoritarian  schools  and  militarist
atmosphere made him want to renounce his citizenship in that country. This
was reinforced by Jost Winteler, who disdained all forms of nationalism and
instilled  in  Einstein  the  belief  that  people  should  consider  themselves
citizens of the world. So he asked his father to help him drop his German
citizenship.  The  release  came  through  in  January  1896,  and  for  the  time
being he was stateless.66

He also that year became a person without a religious affiliation. In the
application  to  renounce  his  German  citizenship,  his  father  had  written,
presumably  at  Albert�s  request,  �no  religious  denomination.�  It  was  a
statement  Albert  would  also  make  when  applying  for  Zurich  residency  a
few years later, and on various occasions over the ensuing two decades.

His rebellion from his childhood fling with ardent Judaism, coupled with
his feelings of detachment from Munich�s Jews, had alienated him from his
heritage. �The religion of the fathers, as I encountered it in Munich during
religious  instruction  and  in  the  synagogue,  repelled  rather  than  attracted
me,� he later explained to a Jewish historian. �The Jewish bourgeois circles
that I came to know in my younger years, with their affluence and lack of a
sense of community, offered me nothing that seemed to be of value.�67

Later in life, beginning with his exposure to virulent anti-Semitism in the
1920s, Einstein would begin to reconnect with his Jewish identity. �There is
nothing in me that can be described as a �Jewish faith,� � he said, �however
I am happy to be a member of the Jewish people.� Later he would make the
same  point  in  more  colorful  ways.  �The  Jew  who  abandons  his  faith,�  he
once said, �is in a similar position to a snail that abandons his shell. He is
still a snail.�68

His renunciation  of Judaism  in  1896  should,  therefore,  be seen not  as a
clean  break  but  as  part  of  a  lifelong  evolution  of  his  feelings  about  his

cultural  identity.  �At  that  time  I  would  not  even  have  understood  what
leaving Judaism could possibly mean,� he wrote a friend the year before he
died.  �But  I  was  fully  aware  of  my  Jewish  origin,  even  though  the  full
significance of belonging to Jewry was not realized by me until later.�69

Einstein ended his year at the Aarau school in a manner that would have
seemed  impressive  for  anyone  except  one  of  history�s  great  geniuses,
scoring the  second highest  grades  in  his  class. (Alas,  the  name  of the  boy
who bested Einstein is lost to history.) On a 1 to 6 scale, with 6 being the
highest, he scored a 5 or 6 in all of his science and math courses as well as
in history and Italian. His lowest grade was a 3, in French.

That qualified him to take a series of exams, written and oral, that would
permit  him,  if  he  passed,  to  enter  the  Zurich  Polytechnic.  On  his  German
exam, he did a perfunctory outline of a Goethe play and scored a 5. In math,
he made a careless mistake, calling a number �imaginary� when he meant
�irrational,�  but  still  got  a  top  grade.  In  physics,  he  arrived  late  and  left
early,  completing  the  two-hour  test  in  an  hour  and  fifteen  minutes;  he  got
the top grade. Altogether, he ended up with a 5.5, the best grade among the
nine students taking the exams.

The  one  section  on  which  he  did  poorly  was  French.  But  his  three-
paragraph essay was, to those of us today, the most interesting part of all of
his exams. The topic was �Mes Projets d�avenir,� my plans for the future.
Although the French was not memorable, the personal insights were:

If  I  am  lucky  and  pass  my  exams,  I  will  enroll  in  the  Zurich
Polytechnic.  I  will  stay  there  four  years  to  study  mathematics  and
physics.  I  suppose  I  will  become  a  teacher  in  these  fields  of  science,
opting for the theoretical part of these sciences.

Here are the reasons that have led me to this plan. They are, most of
all,  my  personal  talent  for  abstract  and  mathematical  thinking  ...  My
desires  have  also  led  me  to  the  same  decision.  That  is  quite  natural;
everybody desires to do that for which he has a talent. Besides, I am
attracted by the independence offered by the profession of science.70

In  the  summer  of  1896,  the  Einstein  brothers�  electrical  business  again
failed, this time because they bungled getting the necessary water rights to
build  a  hydroelectric  system  in  Pavia.  The  partnership  was  dissolved  in  a
friendly  fashion,  and  Jakob  joined  a  large  firm  as  an  engineer.  But

 
Hermann,  whose  optimism  and  pride  tended  to  overwhelm  any  prudence,
insisted on  opening  yet  another new  dynamo  business, this time  in  Milan.
Albert was so dubious of his father�s prospects that he went to his relatives
and suggested that they not finance him again, but they did.71

Hermann hoped that Albert would someday join him in the business, but
engineering held little appeal for him. �I was originally supposed to become
an engineer,� he later wrote a friend, �but the thought of having to expend
my  creative  energy on  things that make  practical  everyday  life  even more
refined,  with  a  bleak  capital  gain  as  the  goal,  was  unbearable  to  me.
Thinking  for  its  own  sake,  like  music!�72  And  thus  he  headed  off  to  the
Zurich Polytechnic.

CHAPTER THREE
THE ZURICH POLYTECHNIC
1896�1900

The Impudent Scholar

The  Zurich  Polytechnic,  with  841  students,  was  mainly  a  teachers�  and
technical  college  when  17-year-old  Albert  Einstein  enrolled  in  October
1896. It was less prestigious than the neighboring University of Zurich and
the  universities  in  Geneva  and  Basel,  all  of  which  could  grant  doctoral
degrees (a status that the Polytechnic, officially named the Eidgen�ssische
Polytechnische  Schule,  would  attain  in  1911  when  it  became  the
Eidgen�ssische  Technische  Hochschule,  or  ETH).  Nevertheless, 
the
Polytechnic had a solid reputation in engineering and science. The head of
the physics department, Heinrich Weber, had recently procured a grand new
building,  funded  by  the  electronics  magnate  (and  Einstein  Brothers
competitor) Werner von Siemens. It housed showcase labs famed for their
precision measurements.

Einstein was one of eleven freshmen enrolled in the section that provided
training �for specialized teachers in mathematics and physics.� He lived in
student lodgings on a monthly stipend of 100 Swiss francs from his Koch
family relatives. Each month he put aside 20 of those francs toward the fee
he would eventually have to pay to become a Swiss citizen.1

Theoretical  physics  was  just  coming  into  its  own  as  an  academic
discipline in the 1890s, with professorships in the field sprouting up across
Europe.  Its  pioneer  practitioners�such  as  Max  Planck  in  Berlin,  Hendrik
Lorentz in Holland, and Ludwig Boltzmann in Vienna�combined physics
with math to suggest paths where experimentalists had yet to tread. Because

 
 
of this, math was supposed to be a major part of Einstein�s required studies
at the Polytechnic.

Einstein, however, had a better intuition for physics than for math, and he
did  not  yet  appreciate how integrally  the  two  subjects  would  be related  in
the pursuit of new theories. During his four years at the Polytechnic, he got
marks of 5 or 6 (on a 6-point scale) in all of his theoretical physics courses,
but got only 4s in most of his math courses, especially those in geometry.
�It  was  not  clear  to  me  as  a  student,�  he  admitted,  �that  a  more  profound
knowledge  of  the  basic  principles  of  physics  was  tied  up  with  the  most
intricate mathematical methods.�2

That realization would sink in a decade later, when he was wrestling with
the  geometry  of  his  theory  of  gravity  and  found  himself  forced  to  rely  on
the help of a math professor who had once called him a lazy dog. �I have
become  imbued  with  great  respect  for  mathematics,�  he  wrote  to  a
colleague  in  1912,  �the  subtler  part  of  which  I  had  in  my  simple-
mindedness regarded as pure luxury until now.� Near the end of his life, he
expressed  a  similar  lament  in  a  conversation  with  a  younger  friend.  �At  a
very early age, I made an assumption that a successful physicist only needs
to  know  elementary  mathematics,�  he  said.  �At  a  later  time,  with  great
regret, I realized that the assumption of mine was completely wrong.�3

His primary  physics  professor was  Heinrich Weber,  the  one who a year
earlier had been so impressed with Einstein that, even after he had failed his
entrance exam to the Polytechnic, he urged him to stay in Zurich and audit
his  lectures.  During  Einstein�s  first  two  years  at  the  Polytechnic,  their
mutual  admiration  endured.  Weber�s  lectures  were  among  the  few  that
impressed  him.  �Weber  lectured  on  heat  with  great  mastery,�  he  wrote
during their second year. �One lecture after another of his pleases me.� He
worked  in  Weber�s  laboratory  �with  fervor  and  passion,�  took  fifteen
courses (five lab and ten classroom) with him, and scored well in them all.4
Einstein,  however,  gradually  became  disenchanted  with  Weber.  He  felt
that  the  professor  focused  too  much  on  the  historical  foundations  of
physics, and he did not deal much with contemporary frontiers. �Anything
that  came  after  Helmholtz  was  simply  ignored,�  one  contemporary  of
Einstein complained. �At the close of our studies, we knew all the past of
physics but nothing of the present and future.�

Notably  absent  from  Weber�s  lectures  was  any  exploration  of  the  great
breakthroughs of James Clerk Maxwell, who, beginning in 1855, developed

profound  theories  and  elegant  mathematical  equations  that  described  how
electromagnetic  waves  such  as  light  propagated.  �We  waited  in  vain  for  a
presentation of Maxwell�s theory,� wrote another fellow student. �Einstein
above all was disappointed.�5

Given his brash attitude, Einstein didn�t hide his feelings. And given his
dignified  sense  of  himself,  Weber  bristled  at  Einstein�s  ill-concealed
disdain. By the end of their four years together they were antagonists.

Weber�s irritation was yet another example of how Einstein�s scientific as
well as personal life was affected by the traits deeply bred into his Swabian
soul:  his  casual  willingness  to  question  authority,  his  sassy  attitude  in  the
face  of  regimentation,  and  his  lack  of  reverence  for  received  wisdom.  He
tended to address Weber, for example, in a rather informal manner, calling
him �Herr Weber� instead of �Herr Professor.�

When  his  frustration  finally  overwhelmed  his  admiration,  Professor
Weber�s  pronouncement  on  Einstein  echoed  that  of  the  irritated  teacher  at
the  Munich  gymnasium  a  few  years  earlier.  �You�re  a  very  clever  boy,
Einstein,�  Weber  told  him.  �An  extremely  clever  boy.  But  you  have  one
great fault: you�ll never let yourself be told anything.�

There was some truth to that assessment. But Einstein was to show that,
in  the  jangled  world  of  physics  at  the  turn  of  the  century,  this  insouciant
ability  to  tune  out  the  conventional  wisdom  was  not  the  worst  fault  to
have.6

Einstein�s impertinence also  got  him into trouble  with  the  Polytechnic�s
other physics professor, Jean Pernet, who was in charge of experimental and
lab  exercises.  In  his  course  Physical  Experiments  for  Beginners,  Pernet
gave  Einstein  a  1,  the  lowest  possible  grade,  thus  earning  himself  the
historic distinction of having flunked Einstein in a physics course. Partly it
was because Einstein seldom showed up for the course. At Pernet�s written
request, in March 1899 Einstein was given an official �director�s reprimand
due to lack of diligence in physics practicum.�7

Why  are  you  specializing  in  physics,  Pernet  asked  Einstein  one  day,
instead of a field like medicine or even law? �Because,� Einstein replied, �I
have even less talent for those subjects. Why shouldn�t I at least try my luck
with physics?�8

On those occasions when Einstein did deign to show up in Pernet�s lab,
his independent streak sometimes got him in trouble, such as the day he was
given  an  instruction  sheet  for  a  particular  experiment.  �With  his  usual

independence,�  his  friend  and  early  biographer  Carl  Seelig  reports,
�Einstein  naturally  flung  the  paper  in  the  waste  paper  basket.�  He
proceeded to pursue the experiment in his own way. �What do you make of
Einstein?� Pernet asked an assistant. �He always does something different
from what I have ordered.�

�He does indeed, Herr Professor,� the assistant replied, �but his solutions

are right and the methods he uses are of great interest.�9

Eventually,  these  methods  caught  up  with  him.  In  July  1899,  he  caused
an  explosion  in  Pernet�s  lab  that  �severely  damaged�  his  right  hand  and
required him to go to the clinic for stitches. The injury made it difficult for
him to write for at least two weeks, and it forced him to give up playing the
violin  for  even  longer.  �My  fiddle  had  to  be  laid  aside,�  he  wrote  to  a
woman  he  had  performed  with  in  Aarau.  �I�m  sure  it  wonders  why  it  is
never  taken  out  of  the  black  case.  It  probably  thinks  it  has  gotten  a
stepfather.�10 He soon resumed playing the violin, but the accident seemed
to  make  him  even  more  wedded  to  the  role  of  theorist  rather  than
experimentalist.

Despite  the  fact  that  he  focused  more  on  physics  than  on  math,  the
professor who would eventually have the most positive impact on him was
the  math  professor  Hermann  Minkowski,  a  square-jawed,  handsome
Russian-born  Jew  in  his  early  thirties.  Einstein  appreciated  the  way
Minkowski tied math to physics, but he avoided the more challenging of his
courses,  which  is  why  Minkowski  labeled  him  a  lazy  dog:  �He  never
bothered about mathematics at all.�11

Einstein preferred to study, based on his own interests and passions, with
one or two friends.12 Even though he was still priding himself on being �a
vagabond  and  a  loner,�  he  began  to  hang  around  the  coffee-houses  and
attend musical soirees with a congenial crowd of bohemian soul mates and
fellow  students.  Despite  his  reputation  for  detachment,  he  forged  lasting
intellectual friendships in Zurich that became important bonds in his life.

Among these was Marcel Grossmann, a middle-class Jewish math wizard
whose  father owned  a factory near  Zurich.  Grossmann  took  copious  notes
that he shared with Einstein, who was less diligent about attending lectures.
�His notes could have been printed and published,� Einstein later marveled
to  Grossmann�s  wife.  �When  it  came  time  to  prepare  for  my  exams,  he
would  always  lend  me  those  notebooks,  and  they  were  my  savior.  What  I
would have done without these books I would rather not speculate on.�

Together  Einstein  and  Grossmann  smoked  pipes  and  drank  iced  coffee
while  discussing  philosophy  at  the  Caf�  Metropole  on  the  banks  of  the
Limmat  River.  �This  Einstein  will  one  day  be  a  great  man,�  Grossmann
predicted  to  his  parents.  He  would  later  help  make  that  prediction  true  by
getting Einstein his first job, at the Swiss Patent Office, and then aiding him
with  the  math  he  needed  to  turn  the  special  theory  of  relativity  into  a
general theory.13

Because  many  of  the  Polytechnic  lectures  seemed  out  of  date,  Einstein
and his friends read the most recent theorists on their own. �I played hooky
a  lot  and  studied  the  masters  of  theoretical  physics  with  a  holy  zeal  at
home,�  he  recalled.  Among  those  were  Gustav  Kirchhoff  on  radiation,
thermodynamics,  Heinrich  Hertz  on
Hermann  von  Helmholtz  on 
electromagnetism, and Boltzmann on statistical mechanics.

He was also influenced by reading a lesser-known theorist, August F�ppl,
who  in  1894  had  written  a  popular  text  titled  Introduction  to  Maxwell�s
Theory of  Electricity.  As  science  historian  Gerald  Holton  has  pointed  out,
F�ppl�s  book  is  filled  with  concepts  that  would  soon  echo  in  Einstein�s
work.  It  has  a  section  on  �The  Electrodynamics  of  Moving  Conductors�
that begins by calling into question the concept of �absolute motion.� The
only  way  to  define motion,  F�ppl  notes,  is  relative  to  another body.  From
there  he  goes  on  to  consider  a  question  concerning  the  induction  of  an
electric current by a magnetic field: �if it is all the same whether a magnet
moves in the vicinity of a resting electric circuit or whether it is the latter
that  moves  while  the  magnet  is  at  rest.�  Einstein  would  begin  his  1905
special relativity paper by raising this same issue.14

Einstein  also  read,  in  his  spare  time,  Henri  Poincar�,  the  great  French
polymath  who  would  come  tantalizingly  close  to  discovering  the  core
concepts  of  special  relativity.  Near  the  end  of  Einstein�s  first  year  at  the
Polytechnic, in the spring of 1897, there was a mathematics conference in
Zurich where the great Poincar� was due to speak. At the last minute he was
unable  to  appear,  but  a  paper  of  his  was  read  there  that  contained  what
would  become  a  famous  proclamation.  �Absolute  space,  absolute  time,
even Euclidean geometry, are not conditions to be imposed on mechanics,�
he wrote.15

The Human Side

One  evening  when  Einstein  was  at  home  with  his  landlady,  he  heard
someone  playing  a  Mozart  piano  sonata.  When  he  asked  who  it  was,  his
landlady told him that it was an old woman who lived in the attic next door
and  taught  piano.  Grabbing  his  violin,  he  dashed  out  without  putting  on  a
collar  or  a  tie.  �You  can�t  go  like  that,  Herr  Einstein,�  the  landlady  cried.
But  he  ignored  her  and  rushed  into  the  neighboring  house.  The  piano
teacher  looked  up,  shocked.  �Go  on  playing,�  Einstein  pleaded.  A  few
moments later, the air was filled with the sounds of a violin accompanying
the Mozart sonata. Later, the teacher asked who the intruding accompanist
was. �Merely a harmless student,� her neighbor reassured her.16

Music continued to beguile Einstein. It was not so much an escape as it
was  a  connection:  to  the  harmony  underlying  the  universe,  to  the  creative
genius  of  the  great  composers,  and  to  other  people  who  felt  comfortable
bonding  with  more  than  just  words.  He  was  awed,  both  in  music  and  in
physics, by the beauty of harmonies.

Suzanne  Markwalder  was  a  young  girl  in  Zurich  whose  mother  hosted
musical evenings featuring mostly Mozart. She played piano, while Einstein
played  violin.  �He  was  very  patient  with  my  shortcomings,�  she  recalled.
�At the worst he used to say, �There you are, stuck like the donkey on the
mountain,�  and  he  would  point  with  his  bow  to  the  place  where  I  had  to
come in.�

What Einstein appreciated in Mozart and Bach was the clear architectural
structure  that  made  their  music  seem  �deterministic�  and,  like  his  own
favorite scientific theories, plucked from the universe rather than composed.
�Beethoven created his music,� Einstein once said, but �Mozart�s music is
so pure it seems to have been ever-present in the universe.� He contrasted
Beethoven with Bach: �I feel uncomfortable listening to Beethoven. I think
he  is  too  personal,  almost  naked.  Give  me  Bach,  rather,  and  then  more
Bach.�

He  also  admired  Schubert  for  his  �superlative  ability  to  express
emotion.�  But  in  a  questionnaire  he  once  filled  out,  he  was  critical  about
other  composers  in  ways  that  reflect  some  of  his  scientific  sentiments:
Handel had �a certain shallowness�; Mendelssohn displayed �considerable
talent but an indefinable lack of depth that often leads to banality�; Wagner
had a �lack of architectural structure I see as decadence�; and Strauss was
�gifted but without inner truth.�17

 
Einstein  also  took  up  sailing,  a  more  solitary  pursuit,  in  the  glorious
Alpine  lakes  around  Zurich.  �I  still  remember  how  when  the  breeze
dropped and the  sails  drooped like withered leaves, he would take  out  his
small  notebook  and  he  would  start  scribbling,�  recalled  Suzanne
Markwalder.  �But  as  soon  as  there  was  a  breath  of  wind  he  was
immediately ready to start sailing again.�18

The  political  sentiments  he  had  felt  as  a  boy�a  contempt  for  arbitrary
authority,  an  aversion  to  militarism  and  nationalism,  a  respect  for
individuality,  a  disdain  for  bourgeois  consumption  or  ostentatious  wealth,
and a desire for social equality�had been encouraged by his landlord and
surrogate father in Aarau, Jost Winteler. Now, in Zurich, he met a friend of
Winteler�s who became a similar political mentor: Gustav Maier, a Jewish
banker who had helped arrange Einstein�s first visit to the Polytechnic. With
support from Winteler, Maier founded the Swiss branch of the Society for
Ethical  Culture,  and  Einstein  was  a  frequent  guest  at  their  informal
gatherings in Maier�s home.

Einstein also came to know and like Friedrich Adler, the son of Austria�s
Social Democratic leader, who was studying in Zurich. Einstein later called
him the  �purest and most fervent idealist�  he had ever  met. Adler tried  to
get Einstein to join the Social Democrats. But it was not Einstein�s style to
spend time at meetings of organized institutions.19

His  distracted  demeanor,  casual  grooming,  frayed  clothing,  and
forgetfulness,  which  were  later  to  make  him  appear  to  be  the  iconic
absentminded  professor,  were  already  evident  in  his  student  days.  He  was
known to leave behind clothes, and sometimes even his suitcase, when he
traveled, and his inability to remember his keys became a running joke with
his landlady. He once visited the home of family friends and, he recalled, �I
left  forgetting  my  suitcase.  My  host  said  to  my  parents,  �That  man  will
never amount to anything because he can�t remember anything.� �20

This  carefree  life  as  a  student  was  clouded  by  the  continued  financial
failings  of  his  father,  who,  against  Einstein�s  advice,  kept  trying  to  set  up
his own businesses rather than go to work for a salary at a stable company,
as Uncle Jakob had finally done. �If I had my way, papa would have looked
for  salaried  employment  two  years  ago,�  he  wrote  his  sister  during  a
particularly  gloomy  moment  in  1898  when  his  father�s  business  seemed
doomed to fail again.

The  letter  was  unusually  despairing,  probably  more  than  his  parents�

financial situation actually warranted:

What  depresses  me  most  is  the  misfortune  of  my  poor  parents  who
have not  had a happy moment  for  so many  years.  What  further  hurts
me deeply is that as an adult man, I have to look on without being able
to do anything. I am nothing but a burden to my family . . . It would be
better off if I were not alive at all. Only the thought that I have always
done what lay in my modest powers, and that I do not permit myself a
single  pleasure  or  distraction  save  for  what  my  studies  offer  me,
sustains me and sometimes protects me from despair.21

Perhaps this was all merely an attack of teenage angst. In any event, his
father  seemed  to  get  through  the  crisis  with  his  usual  optimism.  By  the
following February, he had won contracts for providing street lights to two
small villages near Milan. �I am happy at the thought that the worst worries
are  over  for  our  parents,�  Einstein  wrote  Maja.  �If  everyone  lived  such  a
way,  namely  like  me,  the  writing  of  novels  would  never  have  been
invented.�22

Einstein�s  new  bohemian  life  and  old  self-absorbed  nature  made  it
unlikely  that  he  would  continue  his  relationship  with  Marie  Winteler,  the
sweet and somewhat flighty daughter of the family he had boarded with in
Aarau. At first, he still sent her, via the mail, baskets of his laundry, which
she  would  wash  and  then  return.  Sometimes  there  was  not  even  a  note
attached, but she would cheerfully try to please him. In one letter she wrote
of �crossing the woods in the pouring rain� to the post office to send back
his clean clothes. �In vain did I strain my eyes for a little note, but the mere
sight  of  your  dear  handwriting  in  the  address  was  enough  to  make  me
happy.�

When Einstein sent word that he planned to visit her, Marie was giddy. �I
really thank you, Albert, for wanting to come to Aarau, and I don�t have to
tell  you  that  I  will  be  counting  the  minutes  until  that  time,�  she  wrote.�I
could never describe, because there are no words for it, how blissful I feel
ever since the dear soul of yours has come to live and weave in my soul. I
love you for all eternity, sweetheart.�

But he wanted to break off the relationship. In one of his first letters after
arriving  at  the  Zurich  Polytechnic,  he  suggested  that  they  refrain  from

 
writing  each other. �My love,  I  do not  quite understand a passage  in  your
letter,� she replied. �You write that you do not want to correspond with me
any longer, but why not, sweetheart? ... You must be quite annoyed with me
if you can write so rudely.� Then she tried to laugh off the problem: �But
wait, you�ll get some proper scolding when I get home.�23

Einstein�s next letter was even less friendly, and he complained about a
teapot she had given him. �The matter of my sending you the stupid little
teapot does not have to please you at all as long as you are going to brew
some  good  tea  in  it,�  she  replied.  �Stop  making  that  angry  face  which
looked at me from all the sides and corners of the writing paper.� There was
a  little  boy  in  the  school  where  she  taught  named  Albert,  she  said,  who
looked  like  him.  �I  love  him  ever  so  much,�  she  said.  �Something  comes
over me when he looks at me and I always believe that you are looking at
your little sweetheart.�24

But  then  the  letters  from  Einstein  stopped,  despite  Marie�s  pleas.  She
even wrote his mother for advice. �The rascal has become frightfully lazy,�
Pauline Einstein replied. �I have been waiting in vain for news for these last
three days; I will have to give him a thorough talking-to once he�s here.�25

Finally,  Einstein  declared  the  relationship  over  in  a  letter  to  Marie�s
mother, saying that he would not come to Aarau during his academic break
that spring. �It would be more than unworthy of me to buy a few days of
bliss at the cost of new pain, of which I have already caused too much to the
dear child through my fault,� he wrote.

He  went  on  to  give  a  remarkably  introspective�and  memorable�
assessment  of  how  he  had  begun  to  avoid  the  pain  of  emotional
commitments and the distractions of what he called the �merely personal�
by retreating into science:

It fills me with a peculiar kind of satisfaction that now I myself have to
taste  some  of  the  pain  that  I  brought  upon  the  dear  girl  through  my
thoughtlessness  and  ignorance  of  her  delicate  nature.  Strenuous
intellectual  work  and  looking  at  God�s  nature  are  the  reconciling,
fortifying yet relentlessly strict angels that shall lead me through all of
life�s  troubles.  If  only  I  were  able  to  give  some  of  this  to  the  good
child. And yet, what a peculiar way this is to weather the storms of life
�in many a lucid moment I appear to myself as an ostrich who buries
his head in the desert sand so as not to perceive the danger.26

Einstein�s coolness toward Marie Winteler can seem,  from our vantage,
cruel.  Yet  relationships,  especially  those  of  teenagers,  are  hard  to  judge
from  afar.  They  were  very  different  from  each  other,  particularly
intellectually.  Marie�s  letters,  especially  when  she  was  feeling  insecure,
often descended into babble. �I�m writing a lot of rubbish, isn�t that so, and
in the end you�ll not even read it to the finish (but I don�t believe that),� she
wrote in one. In another, she said, �I do not think about myself, sweetheart,
that�s  quite  true,  but  the  only  reason  for  this  is  that  I  do  not  think  at  all,
except when it comes to some tremendously stupid calculation that requires,
for a change, that I know more than my pupils.�27

Whoever was to blame, if either, it was not surprising that they ended up
on different paths. After her relationship with Einstein ended, Marie lapsed
into a nervous depression, often missing days of teaching, and a few years
later  married  the  manager  of  a  watch  factory.  Einstein,  on  the  other  hand,
rebounded  from  the  relationship  by  falling  into  the  arms  of  someone  who
was just about as different from Marie as could be imagined.

Mileva Mari

Mileva  Mari   was  the  first  and  favorite  child  of  an  ambitious  Serbian
peasant  who  had  joined  the  army,  married  into  modest  wealth,  and  then
dedicated  himself  to  making  sure  that  his  brilliant  daughter  was  able  to
prevail  in  the  male  world  of  math  and  physics.  She  spent  most  of  her
childhood in Novi Sad, a Serbian city then held by Hungary,28 and attended
a variety of ever more demanding schools, at each of which she was at the
top  of  her  class,  culminating  when  her  father  convinced  the  all-male
Classical  Gymnasium  in  Zagreb  to  let  her  enroll.  After  graduating  there
with the top grades in physics and math, she made her way to Zurich, where
she became, just before she turned 21, the only woman in Einstein�s section
of the Polytechnic.

More than three years older than Einstein, afflicted with a congenital hip
dislocation that caused her to limp, and prone to bouts of tuberculosis and
despondency,  Mileva  Mari   was  known  for  neither  her  looks  nor  her
personality. �Very smart and serious, small, delicate, brunette, ugly,� is how
one of her female friends in Zurich described her.

 
 
But  she  had  qualities  that  Einstein,  at  least  during  his  romantic  scholar
years,  found  attractive:  a  passion  for  math  and  science,  a  brooding  depth,
and a beguiling soul. Her deep-set eyes had a haunting intensity, her face an
enticing  touch  of  melancholy.29  She  would  become,  over  time,  Einstein�s
muse, partner, lover, wife, b�te noire, and antagonist, and she would create
an  emotional  field  more  powerful  than  that  of  anyone  else  in  his  life.  It
would alternately attract and repulse him with a force so strong that a mere
scientist like himself would never be able to fathom it.

They  met  when  they  both  entered  the  Polytechnic  in  October  1896,  but
their  relationship  took  a  while  to  develop.  There  is  no  sign,  from  their
letters  or  recollections,  that  they  were  anything  more  than  classmates  that
first academic year. They did, however, decide to go hiking together in the
summer  of  1897.  That  fall,  �frightened  by  the  new  feelings  she  was
experiencing� because  of Einstein,  Mari  decided  to  leave  the  Polytechnic
temporarily and instead audit classes at Heidelberg University.30

Her first surviving letter to Einstein, written a few weeks after she moved
to Heidelberg, shows glimmers of a romantic attraction but also highlights
her self-confident nonchalance. She addresses Einstein with the formal Sie
in  German,  rather  than  the  more  intimate  du.  Unlike  Marie  Winteler,  she
teasingly makes the point that she has not been obsessing about him, even
though he had written an unusually long letter to her. �It�s now been quite a
while  since  I  received  your  letter,�  she  said,  �and  I  would  have  replied
immediately  and  thanked  you  for  the  sacrifice  of  writing  four  long  pages,
would have also told of the joy you provided me through our trip together,
but you said I should write to you someday when I happened to be bored.
And I am very obedient, and I waited and waited for boredom to set in; but
so far my waiting has been in vain.�

Distinguishing Mari  even more from Marie Winteler was the intellectual
intensity of her letters. In this first one, she enthused over the lectures she
had  been  attending  of  Philipp  Lenard,  then  an  assistant  professor  at
Heidelberg,  on  kinetic  theory,  which  explains  the  properties  of  gases  as
being  due  to  the  actions  of  millions  of  individual  molecules.  �Oh,  it  was
really neat at the lecture of Professor Lenard yesterday,� she wrote. �He is
talking now about the kinetic theory of heat and gases. So, it turns out that
the  molecules  of  oxygen  move  with  a  velocity  of  over  400  meters  per
second, then the good professor calculated and calculated . . . and it finally
turned out even though molecules do move with this velocity, they travel a
distance of only 1/100 of a hairbreadth.�

Kinetic  theory  had  not  yet  been  fully  accepted  by  the  scientific
establishment  (nor,  for  that  matter,  had  even  the  existence  of  atoms  and
molecules),  and  Mari �s  letter  indicated  that  she  did  not  have  a  deep
understanding  of  the  subject.  In  addition,  there  was  a  sad  irony:  Lenard
would  be  one  of  Einstein�s  early  inspirations  but  later  one  of  his  most
hateful anti-Semitic tormentors.

Mari   also  commented  on  ideas  Einstein  had  shared  in  his  earlier  letter
about  the  difficulty  mortals  have  in  comprehending  the  infinite.  �I  do  not
believe that the structure of the human brain is to be blamed for the fact that
man  cannot  grasp  infinity,� she wrote. �Man is  very capable of imagining
infinite  happiness,  and  he  should  be  able  to  grasp  the  infinity  of  space�I
think  that  should  be  much  easier.�  There  is  a  slight  echo  of  Einstein�s
escape  from  the  �merely  personal�  into  the  safety  of  scientific  thinking:
finding it easier to imagine infinite space than infinite happiness.

Yet  Mari   was  also,  it  is  clear  from  her  letter,  thinking  of  Einstein  in  a
more personal way. She had even talked to her adoring and protective father
about  him.  �Papa  gave  me  some  tobacco  to  take  with  me  and  I  was
supposed  to  hand  it  to  you  personally,�  she  said.  �He  wanted  so  much  to
whet your appetite for our little land of outlaws. I told him all about you�
you  must  absolutely  come  back  with  me  someday.  The  two  of  you  would
really  have  a  lot  to  talk  about!�  The  tobacco,  unlike  Marie  Winteler�s
teapot, was a present Einstein would likely have wanted, but Mari  teased
that she wasn�t sending it.�You would have to pay duty on it, and then you
would curse me.�31

That conflicting admixture of playfulness and seriousness, of insouciance
and intensity, of intimacy and detachment�so peculiar yet also so evident

in Einstein as well�must have appealed to him. He urged her to return to
Zurich. By February 1898, she had made up her mind to do so, and he was
thrilled. �I�m sure you won�t regret your decision,� he wrote. �You should
come back as soon as possible.�

He gave her a thumbnail of how each of the professors was performing
(admitting  that  he  found  the  one  teaching  geometry  to  be  �a  little
impenetrable�),  and  he  promised  to  help  her  catch  up  with  the  aid  of  the
lecture notes he and Marcel Grossmann had kept. The one problem was that
she would probably not be able to get her �old pleasant room� at the nearby
pension back. �Serves you right, you little runaway!�32

By April she was back, in a boarding house a few blocks from his, and
now  they  were  a  couple.  They  shared  books,  intellectual  enthusiasms,
intimacies, and access to each other�s apartments. One day, when he again
forgot  his  key  and  found  himself  locked  out  of  his  own  place,  he  went  to
hers and borrowed her copy of a physics text. �Don�t be angry with me,� he
said in the little note he left her. Later that year, a similar note left for her
added, �If you don�t mind, I�d like to come over this evening to read with
you.�33

Friends  were  surprised  that  a  sensuous  and  handsome  man  such  as
Einstein,  who  could  have  almost  any  woman  fall  for  him,  would  find
himself with a short and plain Serbian who had a limp and exuded an air of
melancholy. �I would never be brave enough to marry a woman unless she
were  absolutely  healthy,�  a  fellow  student  said  to  him.  Einstein  replied,
�But she has such a lovely voice.�34

Einstein�s mother, who had adored Marie Winteler, was similarly dubious
about  the  dark  intellectual  who  had  replaced  her.  �Your  photograph  had
quite an effect on my old lady,� Einstein wrote from Milan, where he was
visiting  his  parents  during  spring  break  of  1899.  �While  she  studied  it
carefully,  I  said  with  the  deepest  sympathy:  �Yes,  yes,  she  certainly  is  a
clever one.� I�ve already had to endure much teasing about this.�35

It is easy to see why Einstein felt such an affinity for Mari . They were
kindred  spirits  who  perceived  themselves  as  aloof  scholars  and  outsiders.
Slightly  rebellious 
they  were  both
intellectuals who sought as a lover someone who would also be a partner,
colleague, and collaborator. �We understand each other�s dark souls so well,
and also drinking coffee and eating sausages, etcetera,� Einstein wrote her.

toward  bourgeois  expectations, 

He had a way of making the etcetera  sound roguish. He  closed  another
letter:  �Best  wishes etc.,  especially  the  latter.� After  being  apart for  a few
weeks, he listed the things he liked to do with her: �Soon I�ll be with my
sweetheart again and can kiss her, hug her, make coffee with her, scold her,
study  with  her,  laugh  with  her,  walk  with  her,  chat  with  her,  and  ad
infinitum!�  They  took  pride  in  sharing  a  quirkiness.  �I�m  the  same  old
rogue as I�ve always been,� he wrote, �full of whims and mischief, and as
moody as ever!�36

Above  all,  Einstein  loved  Mari   for  her  mind.  �How  proud  I  will  be  to
have a little Ph.D. for a sweetheart,� he wrote to her at one point. Science
and romance seemed to be interwoven. While on vacation with his family in
1899, Einstein lamented in a letter to Mari , �When I read Helmholtz for the
first time I could not�and still cannot�believe that I was doing so without
you sitting next to me. I enjoy working together and I find it soothing and
also less boring.�

Indeed,  most  of  their  letters  mixed  romantic  effusions  with  scientific
enthusiasms, often with an emphasis on the latter. In one letter, for example,
he foreshadowed not only the title but also some of the concepts of his great
paper  on  special  relativity.  �I  am  more  and  more  convinced  that  the
electrodynamics  of  moving  bodies  as  it  is  presented  today  does  not
correspond  to  reality  and  that  it  will  be  possible  to  present  it  in  a  simpler
way,�  he  wrote.  �The  introduction  of  the  term  �ether�  into  theories  of
electricity  has  led  to  the  conception  of  a  medium  whose  motion  can  be
described without, I believe, being able to ascribe physical meaning to it.�37
Even  though  this  mix  of  intellectual  and  emotional  companionship
appealed  to  him,  every  now  and  then  he  recalled  the  enticement  of  the
simpler desire represented by Marie Winteler. And with the tactlessness that
masqueraded for him as honesty (or perhaps because of his puckish desire
to  torment),  he  let  Mari   know  it.  After  his  1899  summer  vacation,  he
decided  to  take  his  sister  to  enroll  in  school  in  Aarau,  where  Marie  lived.
He wrote Mari  to assure her that he would not spend much time with his
former  girlfriend,  but  the  pledge  was  written  in  a  way  that  was,  perhaps
intentionally, more unsettling than reassuring. �I won�t be going to Aarau as
often now that the daughter I was so madly in love with four years ago is
coming back home,�  he said.  �For the  most part  I  feel quite secure  in  my
high  fortress  of  calm.  But  I  know  that  if  I  saw  her  a  few  more  times,  I
would certainly go mad. Of that I am certain, and I fear it like fire.�

But the letter goes on, happily for Mari , with a description of what they
would  do  when  they  met  back  in  Zurich,  a  passage  in  which  Einstein
showed  once  again  why  their  relationship  was  so  special.  �The  first  thing
we�ll do is climb the �tliberg,� he said, referring to a high point just out of
town.  There  they  would  be  able  to  �take  pleasure  in  unpacking  our
memories� of the things they had done together on other hiking trips. �I can
already  imagine  the  fun  we  will  have,�  he  wrote.  Finally,  with  a  flourish
only they could have fully appreciated, he concluded, �And then we�ll start
in on Helmholtz�s electromagnetic theory of light.�38

In  the  ensuing  months,  their  letters  became  even  more  intimate  and
passionate. He began calling her Doxerl (Dollie), as well as �my wild little
rascal� and �my street urchin�; she called him Johannzel (Johnnie) and �my
wicked little sweetheart.� By the start of 1900, they were using the familiar
du  with  one  another,  a  process  that  began  with  a  little  note  from  her  that
reads, in full:

My little Johnnie,

Because I like you so much, and because you�re so far away that I
can�t give you a little kiss, I�m writing this letter to ask if you like me
as much as I do you? Answer me immediately.

A thousand kisses from your Dollie39

Graduation, August 1900

Academically,  things  were  also  going  well  for  Einstein.  In  his
intermediate exams in October 1898, he had finished first in his class, with
an average of 5.7 out of a possible 6. Finishing second, with a 5.6, was his
friend and math note-taker Marcel Grossmann.40

To graduate, Einstein had to do a research thesis. He initially proposed to
Professor  Weber  that  he  do  an  experiment  to  measure  how  fast  the  earth
was  moving  through  the  ether,  the  supposed  substance  that  allowed  light
waves to propagate through space. The accepted wisdom, which he would

 
 
famously destroy with his special theory of relativity, was that if the earth
were moving through this ether toward or away from the source of a light
beam, we�d be able to detect a difference in the observed speed of the light.
During his visit to Aarau at the end of his summer vacation of 1899, he
worked on this issue with the rector of his old school there. �I had a good
idea  for  investigating  the  way  in  which  a  body�s  relative  motion  with
respect  to  the  ether  affects  the  velocity  of  the  propagation  of  light,�  he
wrote Mari . His idea involved building an apparatus that would use angled
mirrors  �so  that  light  from  a  single  source  would  be  reflected  in  two
different  directions,�  sending  one  part  of  the  beam  in  the  direction  of  the
earth�s  movement  and  the  other  part  of  the  beam  perpendicular  to  it.  In  a
lecture on how he discovered relativity, Einstein recalled that his idea was
to split a light beam, reflect it in different directions, and see if there was �a
difference  in  energy  depending  on  whether  or  not  the  direction  was  along
the  earth�s  motion  through  the  ether.�  This  could  be  done,  he  posited,  by
�using  two  thermoelectric  piles  to  examine  the  difference  of  the  heat
generated in them.�41

Weber rejected the proposal. What Einstein did not fully realize was that
similar  experiments  had  already  been  done  by  many  others,  including  the
Americans Albert Michelson and Edward Morley, and none had been able
to  detect  any  evidence  of  the  perplexing  ether�or  that  the  speed  of  light
varied  depending  on  the  motion  of  the  observer  or  the  light  source.  After
discussing  the  topic  with  Weber,  Einstein  read  a  paper  delivered  the
thirteen
previous  year  by  Wilhelm  Wien,  which  briefly  described 
experiments  that  had  been  conducted  to  detect  the  ether,  including  the
Michelson-Morley one.

Einstein sent Professor Wien his own speculative paper on that topic and
asked him to write him back. �He�ll write me via the Polytechnic,� Einstein
predicted to Mari . �If you see a letter there for me, you may go ahead and
open it.� There is no evidence that Wien ever wrote back.42

Einstein�s next research proposal involved exploring the link between the
ability  of  different  materials  to  conduct  heat  and  to  conduct  electricity,
something that was suggested by the electron theory. Weber apparently did
not like that idea either, so Einstein was reduced, along with Mari , to doing
a study purely on heat conduction, which was one of Weber�s specialties.

Einstein later dismissed their graduation research papers as being of �no
interest to me.� Weber gave Einstein and Mari  the two lowest essay grades

in the class, a 4.5 and a 4.0, respectively; Grossmann, by comparison, got a
5.5.  Adding  annoyance  to  that  injury,  Weber  said  that  Einstein  had  not
written  his  on  the  proper  regulation  paper,  and  he  forced  him  to  copy  the
entire essay over again.43

Despite the low mark on his essay, Einstein was able to eke by with a 4.9
average  in  his  final  set  of  grades,  placing  him  fourth  in  his  class  of  five.
Although  history  refutes  the  delicious  myth  that  he  flunked  math  in  high
school,  at  least  it  does  offer  as  a  consolation  the  amusement  that  he
graduated college near the bottom of his class.

At least he graduated. His 4.9 average was just enough to let him get his
diploma,  which  he  did  officially  in  July  1900.  Mileva  Mari ,  however,
managed only a 4.0, by far the lowest in the class, and was not allowed to
graduate. She determined that she would try again the following year.44

Not surprisingly, Einstein�s years at the Polytechnic were marked by his
pride  at  casting  himself  as  a  nonconformist.  �His  spirit  of  independence
asserted  itself  one  day  in  class  when  the  professor  mentioned  a  mild
disciplinary  measure  just  taken  by  the  school�s  authorities,�  a  classmate
recalled. Einstein protested. The fundamental requirement of education, he
felt, was the �need for intellectual freedom.�45

Throughout  his  life,  Einstein  would  speak  lovingly  of  the  Zurich
Polytechnic, but he also would note that he did not like the discipline that
was  inherent  in  the  system  of  examinations.  �The  hitch  in  this  was,  of
course,  that  one  had  to  cram  all  this  stuff  into  one�s  mind  for  the
examinations, whether one liked it or not,� he said. �This coercion had such
a deterring effect that, after I had passed the final examination, I found the
consideration  of  any  scientific  problems  distasteful  to  me  for  an  entire
year.�46

In reality, that was neither possible nor true. He was cured within weeks,
and  he  ended  up  taking  with  him  some  science  books,  including  texts  by
Gustav Kirchhoff  and Ludwig  Boltzmann,  when  he joined his  mother  and
sister later that July for their summer holiday in the Swiss Alps. �I�ve been
studying  a  great  deal,�  he  wrote  Mari ,  �mainly  Kirch-hoff  �s  notorious
investigations  of  the  motion  of  the  rigid  body.�  He  admitted  that  his
resentment over the exams had already worn off. �My nerves have calmed
down  enough  so  that  I�m  able  to  work  happily  again,�  he  said.  �How  are
yours?�47

1900�1904

With Mileva and Hans Albert Einstein, 1904

Summer Vacation, 1900

Newly  graduated,  carrying  his  Kirchhoff  and  other  physics  books,
Einstein arrived at the end of July 1900 for his family�s summer vacation in
Melchtal, a village nestled in the Swiss Alps between Lake Lucerne and the
border with northern Italy. In tow was his �dreadful aunt,� Julia Koch. They
were met at the train station by his mother and sister, who smothered him
with kisses, and then all piled into a carriage for the ride up the mountain.

 
 
 
 
As  they  neared  the  hotel,  Einstein  and  his  sister  got  off  to  walk.  Maja
confided that she had not dared to discuss with their mother his relationship
with  Mileva  Mari ,  known  in  the  family  as  �the  Dollie  affair�  after  his
nickname for her, and she asked him to �go easy on Mama.� It was not in
Einstein�s nature, however, �to keep my big mouth shut,� as he later put it
in his letter to Mari  about the scene, nor was it in his nature to protect Mari
�s feelings by sparing her all the dramatic details about what ensued.1

He  went  to  his  mother�s  room  and,  after  hearing  about  his  exams,  she

asked him, �So, what will become of your Dollie now?�

�My wife,� Einstein answered, trying to affect the same nonchalance that

his mother had used in her question.

His mother, Einstein recalled, �threw herself on the bed, buried her head
in  the  pillow,  and  wept  like  a  child.�  She  was  finally  able  to  regain  her
composure and proceeded to go on the attack. �You are ruining your future
and destroying  your opportunities,� she said.  �No  decent  family will have
her. If she gets pregnant you�ll really be in a mess.�

At that point, it was Einstein�s turn to lose his composure. �I vehemently
denied  we  had been living  in  sin,�  he reported to  Mari ,  �and scolded  her
roundly.�

Just  as  he  was  about  to  storm  out,  a  friend  of  his  mother�s  came  in,  �a
small,  vivacious  lady,  an  old  hen  of  the  most  pleasant  variety.�  They
promptly  segued  into  the  requisite  small  talk:  about  the  weather,  the  new
guests at the spa, the ill-mannered children. Then they went off to eat and
play music.

Such periods of storm and calm alternated throughout the vacation. Every
now  and  then,  just  when  Einstein  thought  that  the  crisis  had  receded,  his
mother  would  revisit  the  topic.�Like  you,  she�s  a  book,  but  you  ought  to
have a wife,� she scolded at one point. Another time she brought up the fact
that Mari  was 24 and he was then only 21. �By the time you�re 30, she�ll
be an old witch.�

Einstein�s  father,  still  working  back  in  Milan,  weighed  in  with  �a
moralistic letter.� The thrust of his parents� views�at least when applied to
the situation of Mileva Mari  rather than Marie Winteler�was that a wife
was  �a  luxury�  affordable  only  when  a  man  was  making  a  comfortable
living. �I have a low opinion of that view of a relationship between a man
and  wife,�  he  told  Mari ,�because  it  makes  the  wife  and  the  prostitute

distinguishable  only  insofar  as  the  former  is  able  to  secure  a  lifelong
contract.�2

Over the ensuing months, there would be times when it seemed as if his
parents had decided to accept their relationship. �Mama is slowly resigning
herself,�  Einstein  wrote  Mari   in  August.  Likewise  in  September:  �They
seem to have reconciled themselves to the inevitable. I think they will both
come to like you very much once they get to know you.� And once again in
October: �My parents have retreated, grudgingly and with hesitation, from
the battle of Dollie�now that they have seen that they�ll lose it.�3

But  repeatedly,  after  each  period  of  acceptance,  their  resistance  would
flare up anew, randomly leaping into a higher state of frenzy. �Mama often
cries bitterly  and I  don�t have a single  moment  of peace,�  he wrote at  the
end of August. �My parents weep for me almost as if I had died. Again and
again  they  complain  that  I  have  brought  misfortune  upon  myself  by  my
devotion to you. They think you are not healthy.�4

His  parents�  dismay  had  little  to  do  with  the  fact  that  Mari   was  not
Jewish, for neither was Marie Winteler, nor that she was Serbian, although
that certainly didn�t help her cause. Primarily, it seems, they considered her
an unsuitable wife for many of the reasons that some of Einstein�s friends
did: she was older, somewhat sickly, had a limp, was plain looking, and was
an intense but not a star intellectual.

All  of  this  emotional  pressure  stoked  Einstein�s  rebellious  instincts  and
his passion for his �wild street urchin,� as he called her. �Only now do I see
how  madly  in  love  with  you  I  am!�The  relationship,  as  expressed  in  their
letters,  remained  equal  parts  intellectual  and  emotional,  but  the  emotional
part was now filled with a fire unexpected from a self-proclaimed loner. �I
just realized that I haven�t been able to kiss you for an entire month, and I
long for you so terribly much,� he wrote at one point.

During a quick trip to Zurich in August to check on his job prospects, he
found  himself  walking  around  in  a  daze.  �Without  you,  I  lack  self-
confidence, pleasure in my work, pleasure in life�in short, without you my
life is not life.� He even tried his hand at a poem for her, which began: �Oh
my! That Johnnie boy! / So crazy with desire / While thinking of his Dollie
/ His pillow catches fire.�5

Their passion, however, was an elevated one, at least in their minds. With
the  lonely  elitism  of  young  German  coffeehouse  denizens  who  have  read
the  philosophy  of  Schopenhauer  once  too  often,  they  un-abashedly

articulated  the  mystical  distinction  between  their  own  rarefied  spirits  and
the baser instincts and urges of the masses. �In the case of my parents, as
with  most  people,  the  senses  exercise  a  direct  control  over  the  emotions,�
he  wrote  her  amid  the  family  wars  of  August.  �With  us,  thanks  to  the
fortunate  circumstances  in  which  we  live,  the  enjoyment  of  life  is  vastly
broadened.�

To  his  credit,  Einstein  reminded  Mari   (and  himself)  that  �we  mustn�t
forget that many existences like my parents� make our existence possible.�
The simple and honest instincts of people like his parents had ensured the
progress  of  civilization.  �Thus  I  am  trying  to  protect  my  parents  without
compromising  anything  that  is  important  to  me�and  that  means  you,
sweetheart!�

In  his  attempt  to  please  his  mother,  Einstein  became  a  charming  son  at
their grand hotel in Melchtal. He found the endless meals excessive and the
�overdressed�  patrons  to  be  �indolent  and  pampered,�  but  he  dutifully
played  his  violin  for  his  mother�s  friends,  made  polite  conversation,  and
feigned a cheerful mood. It worked. �My popularity among the guests here
and my music successes act as a balm on my mother�s heart.�6

As  for  his  father,  Einstein  decided  that  the  best  way  to  assuage  him,  as
well  as  to  draw  off  some  of  the  emotional  charge  generated  by  his
relationship with  Mari ,  was  to  visit  him  back  in  Milan,  tour  some  of  his
new  power  plants,  and  learn  about  the  family  firm  �so  I  can  take  Papa�s
place  in  an  emergency.�  Hermann  Einstein  seemed  so  pleased  that  he
promised to take his son to Venice after the inspection tour. �I�m leaving for
Italy  on  Saturday  to  partake  of  the  �holy  sacraments�  administered  by  my
father, but the valiant Swabian* is not afraid.�

Einstein�s visit with his father went well, for the most part. A distant yet
dutiful  son,  he  had  fretted  mightily  about  each  family  financial  crisis,
perhaps  even  more  than  his  father  did.  But  business  was  good  for  the
moment,  and  that  lifted  Hermann  Einstein�s  spirits.  �My  father  is  a
completely  different  man  now  that  he  has  no  more  financial  worries,�
Einstein  wrote Mari .  Only  once  did  the  �Dollie  affair�  intrude  enough  to
make  him  consider  cutting  short  his  visit,  but  this  threat  so  alarmed  his
father that Einstein stuck to the original plans. He seemed flattered that his
father appreciated both his company and his willingness to pay attention to
the family business.7

Even  though  Einstein  occasionally  denigrated  the  idea  of  being  an
engineer, it was possible that he could have followed that course at the end
of the summer of 1900�especially if, on their trip to Venice, his father had
asked him to, or if fate intervened so that he was needed to take his father�s
place. He was, after all, a low-ranked graduate of a teaching college without
a  teaching  job,  without  any  research  accomplishments,  and  certainly
without academic patrons.

Had he made such a choice in 1900, Einstein would have likely become a
good enough engineer, but probably not a great one. Over the ensuing years
he would dabble with inventions as a hobby and come up with some good
concepts for devices ranging from noiseless refrigerators to a machine that
measured  very  low  voltage  electricity.  But  none  resulted  in  a  significant
engineering  breakthrough  or  marketplace  success.  Though  he  would  have
been a more brilliant engineer than his father or uncle, it is not clear that he
would have been any more financially successful.

Among the many surprising things about the life of Albert Einstein was
the  trouble  he  had  getting  an  academic  job.  Indeed,  it  would  be  an
astonishing nine  years  after his  graduation  from the  Zurich  Polytechnic in
1900�and four years after the miracle year in which he not only upended
physics  but  also  finally  got  a  doctoral  dissertation  accepted�before  he
would be offered a job as a junior professor.

The  delay  was  not  due  to  a  lack  of  desire  on  his  part.  In  the  middle  of
August  1900,  between  his  family  vacation  in  Melchtal  and  his  visit  to  his
father in Milan, Einstein stopped back in Zurich to see about getting a post
as  an  assistant  to  a  professor  at  the  Polytechnic.  It  was  typical  that  each
graduate  would  find,  if  he  wanted,  some  such  role,  and  Einstein  was
confident it would happen. In the meantime, he rejected a friend�s offer to
help him get a job at an insurance company, dismissing it as �an eight hour
day of mindless drudgery.� As  he told Mari ,  �One  must  avoid  stultifying
affairs.�8

The problem was that the two physics professors at the Polytechnic were
acutely  aware  of  his  impudence  but  not  of  his  genius.  Getting  a  job  with
Professor Pernet, who had reprimanded him, was not even a consideration.
As for Professor Weber, he had developed such an allergy to Einstein that,
when no other graduates of the physics and math department were available
to become his assistant, he instead hired two students from the engineering
division.

That  left  math  professor  Adolf  Hurwitz.  When  one  of  Hurwitz�s
assistants  got  a  job  teaching  at  a  high  school,  Einstein  exulted  to  Mari :
�This means I will become Hurwitz�s servant, God willing.� Unfortunately,
he had skipped most of Hurwitz�s classes, a slight that apparently had not
been forgotten.9

By  late  September,  Einstein  was  still  staying  with  his  parents  in  Milan
and had not received an offer. �I plan on going to Zurich on October 1 to
talk  with  Hurwitz  personally  about  the  position,�  he  said.  �It�s  certainly
better than writing.�

While there, he also planned to look for possible tutoring jobs that could
tide them over while Mari  prepared to retake her final exams. �No matter
what  happens,  we�ll  have  the  most  wonderful  life  in  the  world.  Pleasant
work and being together�and what�s more, we now answer to no one, can
stand on our own two feet, and enjoy our youth to the utmost. Who could
have it any better? When we have scraped together enough money, we can
buy bicycles and take a bike tour every couple of weeks.�10

Einstein  ended  up  deciding  to  write  Hurwitz  instead  of  visiting  him,
which was  probably a mistake. His two  letters  do not  stand  as models  for
future  generations  seeking  to  learn  how  to  write  a  job  application.  He
readily conceded that he did not show up at Hurwitz�s calculus classes and
was more interested in physics than math. �Since lack of time prevented me
from taking part in the mathematics seminar,� he rather lamely said, �there
is  nothing  in  my  favor  except  the  fact  that  I  attended  most  of  the  lectures
offered.�  Rather  presumptuously,  he  said  he  was  eager  for  an  answer
because �the granting of citizenship in Zurich, for which I have applied, has
been made conditional upon my proving that I have a permanent job.�11

Einstein�s  impatience  was  matched  by  his  confidence.  �Hurwitz  still
hasn�t  written  me  more,�  he  said  only  three  days  after  sending  his  letter,
�but  I  have  hardly  any  doubt  that  I  will  get  the  position.�  He  did  not.
Indeed, he managed to become the only person graduating in his section of
the Polytechnic who was not offered a job. �I was suddenly abandoned by
everyone,� he later recalled.12

By  the  end  of  October  1900  he  and  Mari   were  both  back  in  Zurich,
where he spent most of his days hanging out at her apartment, reading and
writing. On his citizenship application that month, he wrote �none� on the
question asking his religion, and for his occupation he wrote, �I am giving
private lessons in mathematics until I get a permanent position.�

Throughout  that  fall,  he  was  able  to  find  only  eight  sporadic  tutoring
jobs, and his relatives had ended their financial support. But Einstein put up
an optimistic front. �We support ourselves by private lessons, if we can ever
pick  up  some,  which  is  still  very  doubtful,�  he  wrote  a  friend  of  Mari �s.
�Isn�t this a journeyman�s or even a gypsy�s life? But I believe that we will
remain cheerful in it as ever.�13 What kept him happy, in addition to Mari �s
presence, were the theoretical papers he was writing on his own.

Einstein�s First Published Paper

The first of these papers was on a topic familiar to most school kids: the
capillary effect that, among other things, causes water to cling to the side of
a straw and curve upward. Although he later called this essay �worthless,�
it  is  interesting  from  a  biographical  perspective.  Not  only  is  it  Einstein�s
first  published  paper,  but  it  shows  him  heartily  embracing  an  important
premise�one not yet fully accepted�that would be at the core of much of
his  work  over  the  next  five  years:  that  molecules  (and  their  constituent
atoms)  actually  exist,  and  that  many  natural  phenomena  can  be  explained
by analyzing how these particles interact with one another.

During his vacation in the summer of 1900, Einstein had been reading the
work of Ludwig Boltzmann, who had developed a theory of gases based on
the  behavior  of  countless  molecules  bouncing  around.  �The  Boltzmann  is
absolutely  magnificent,�  he  enthused  to  Mari   in  September.  �I  am  firmly
convinced  of  the  correctness  of  the  principles  of  his  theory,  i.e.,  I  am
convinced  that  in  the  case  of  gases  we  are  really  dealing  with  discrete
particles  of  definite  finite  size  which  move  according 
to  certain
conditions.�14

To understand capillarity, however, required looking at the forces acting
between  molecules  in  a  liquid,  not  a  gas.  Such  molecules  attract  one
another, which accounts for the surface tension of a liquid, or the fact that
drops hold together, as well as for the capillary effect. Einstein�s idea was
that  these  forces  might  be  analogous  to  Newton�s  gravitational  forces,  in
which two objects are attracted to each other in proportion to their mass and
in inverse proportion to their distance from one another.

Einstein looked at whether the capillary effect showed such a relationship
to the atomic weight of various liquid substances. He was encouraged, so he

 
decided  to  see  if  he  could  find  some  experimental  data  to  test  the  theory
further. �The results on capillarity I recently obtained in Zurich seem to be
entirely new despite their simplicity,� he wrote Mari . �When we�re back in
Zurich we�ll try to get some empirical data on this subject . . . If this yields
a law of nature, we�ll send the results to the Annalen.�15

He did end up sending the paper in December 1900 to the Annalen  der
Physik, Europe�s leading physics journal, which published it the following
March.  Written  without  the  elegance  or  verve  of  his  later  papers,  it
conveyed  what  is  at  best  a  tenuous  conclusion.  �I  started  from  the  simple
idea of attractive forces among the molecules, and I tested the consequences
experimentally,�  he  wrote.  �I  took  gravitational  forces  as  an  analogy.�  At
the end of the paper, he declares limply, �The question of whether and how
our  forces  are  related  to  gravitational  forces  must  therefore  be  left
completely open for the time being.�16

The paper elicited no comments and contributed nothing to the history of
physics. Its basic conjecture was wrong, as the distance dependence is not
the same for differing pairs of molecules.17 But it did get him published for
the first time. That meant that he now had a printed article to attach to the
job-seeking letters with which he was beginning to spam professors all over
Europe.

In his letter to Mari , Einstein  had used the  term  �we�  when  discussing
plans to publish the paper. In two letters written the month after it appeared,
Einstein  referred 
theory  of  molecular  forces�  and  �our
investigation.�Thus was launched a historical debate over how much credit
Mari  deserves for helping Einstein devise his theories.

to  �our 

In this case, she mainly seemed to be involved in looking up some data
for him to use. His letters conveyed his latest thoughts on molecular forces,
but hers contained no substantive science. And in a letter to her best friend,
Mari  sounded as if she had settled into the role of supportive lover rather
than  scientific  partner.  �Albert  has  written  a  paper  in  physics  that  will
probably  be  published  very  soon  in  the  Annalen  der  Physik,�  she  wrote.
�You can imagine how very proud I am of my darling. This is not just an
everyday  paper,  but  a  very  significant  one.  It  deals  with  the  theory  of
liquids.�18

Jobless Anguish

It had been almost four years since Einstein had renounced his German
citizenship, and ever since then he had been stateless. Each month, he put
aside some money toward the fee he would need to pay to become a Swiss
citizen,  a  status  he  deeply  desired.  One  reason  was  that  he  admired  the
Swiss system, its democracy, and its gentle respect for individuals and their
privacy. �I like the Swiss because, by and large, they are more humane than
the  other  people  among  whom  I  have  lived,�  he  later  said.19  There  were
also practical reasons; in order to work as a civil servant or a teacher in a
state school, he would have to be a Swiss citizen.

The  Zurich  authorities  examined  him  rather  thoroughly,  and  they  even
sent  to  Milan  for  a  report  on  his  parents.  By  February  1901,  they  were
satisfied,  and  he  was  made  a  citizen.  He  would  retain  that  designation  his
entire  life,  even  as  he  accepted  citizenships  in  Germany  (again),  Austria,
and the United States. Indeed, he was so eager to be a Swiss citizen that he
put aside his antimilitary sentiments and presented himself, as required, for
military  service.  He  was  rejected  for  having  sweaty  feet  (�hyperidrosis
ped�), flat feet (�pes planus�), and varicose veins (�varicosis�). The Swiss
Army  was,  apparently,  quite  discriminating,  and  so  his  military  service
book was stamped �unfit.�20

A  few  weeks  after  he  got  his  citizenship,  however,  his  parents  insisted
that  he  come  back  to  Milan  and  live  with  them.  They  had  decreed,  at  the
end of 1900, that he could not stay in Zurich past Easter unless he got a job
there. When Easter came, he was still unemployed.

Mari , not unreasonably, assumed that his summons to Milan was due to
his parents� antipathy toward her. �What utterly depressed me was the fact
that our separation had to come about in such an unnatural way, on account
of slanders and intrigues,� she wrote her friend. With an absentmindedness
he  was  later  to  make  iconic,  Einstein  left  behind  in  Zurich  his  nightshirt,
toothbrush,  comb,  hairbrush  (back  then  he  used  one),  and  other  toiletries.
�Send everything along to my sister,� he instructed Mari , �so she can bring
them home with her.� Four days later, he added, �Hold on to my umbrella
for the time being. We�ll figure out something to do with it later.�21

Both  in  Zurich  and  then  in  Milan,  Einstein  churned  out  job-seeking
letters,  ever  more  pleading,  to  professors  around  Europe.  They  were
accompanied  by  his  paper  on  the  capillary  effect,  which  proved  not
particularly impressive; he rarely even received the courtesy of a response.

 
�I will soon have graced every physicist from the North Sea to the southern
tip of Italy with my offer,� he wrote Mari .22

By April 1901, Einstein was reduced to buying a pile of postcards with
postage-paid  reply  attachments in  the  forlorn hope that he would, at  least,
get an answer. In the two cases where these postcard pleas have survived,
they have become, rather amusingly, prized collectors� items. One of them,
to  a  Dutch  professor,  is  now  on  display  in  the  Leiden  Museum  for  the
History of Science. In both cases, the return-reply attachment was not used;
Einstein  did  not  even  get  the  courtesy  of  a  rejection.  �I  leave  no  stone
unturned  and  do  not  give  up  my  sense  of  humor,�  he  wrote  his  friend
Marcel Grossmann. �God created the donkey and gave him a thick skin.�23
Among  the  great  scientists  Einstein  wrote  was  Wilhelm  Ostwald,
professor  of  chemistry  in  Leipzig,  whose  contributions  to  the  theory  of
dilution were to earn him a Nobel Prize. �Your work on general chemistry
inspired  me  to  write  the  enclosed  article,�  Einstein  said.  Then  flattery
turned  to  plaintiveness  as  he  asked  �whether  you  might  have  use  for  a
mathematical  physicist.�  Einstein  concluded  by  pleading:  �I  am  without
money,  and  only  a  position  of  this  kind  would  enable  me  to  continue  my
studies.� He got no answer. Einstein wrote again two weeks later using the
pretext �I am not sure whether I included my address� in the earlier letter.
�Your judgment of my paper matters very much to me.� There was still no
answer.24

Einstein�s  father,  with  whom  he  was  living  in  Milan,  quietly  shared  his
son�s  anguish  and  tried,  in  a  painfully  sweet  manner,  to  help.  When  no
answer  came  after  the  second  letter  to  Ostwald,  Hermann  Einstein  took  it
upon  himself,  without  his  son�s  knowledge,  to  make  an  unusual  and
awkward  effort,  suffused  with  heart-wrenching  emotion,  to  prevail  upon
Ostwald himself:

Please forgive a father who is so bold as to turn to you, esteemed Herr
Professor, in the interest of his son. Albert is 22 years old, he studied at
the  Zurich  Polytechnic  for  four  years,  and  he  passed  his  exam  with
flying colors last summer. Since then he has been trying unsuccessfully
to  get  a  position  as  a  teaching  assistant,  which  would  enable  him  to
continue  his  education  in  physics.  All  those  in  a  position  to  judge
praise  his  talents;  I  can  assure  you  that  he  is  extraordinarily  studious
and  diligent  and  clings  with  great  love  to  his  science.  He  therefore

feels  profoundly  unhappy  about  his  current  lack  of  a  job,  and  he
becomes more and more convinced that he has gone off the tracks with
his  career.  In  addition,  he  is  oppressed  by  the  thought  that  he  is  a
burden on us, people of modest means. Since it is you whom my son
seems to admire and esteem more than any other scholar in physics, it
is  you  to  whom  I  have  taken  the  liberty  of  turning  with  the  humble
request to read his paper and to write to him, if possible, a few words
of  encouragement,  so  that  he  might  recover  his  joy  in  living  and
working. If, in addition, you could secure him an assistant�s position,
my gratitude would know no bounds. I beg you to forgive me for my
impudence in writing you, and my son does not know anything about
my unusual step.25

Ostwald still did not answer. However, in one of history�s nice ironies, he
would become, nine years later, the first person to nominate Einstein for the
Nobel Prize.

Einstein  was  convinced  that  his  nemesis  at  the  Zurich  Polytechnic,
physics professor Heinrich Weber, was behind the difficulties. Having hired
two engineers rather than Einstein as his own assistant, he was apparently
now  giving  him  unfavorable  references.  After  applying  for  a  job  with
G�ttingen  professor  Eduard  Riecke,  Einstein  despaired  to  Mari :  �I  have
more  or  less  given  up  the  position  as  lost.  I  cannot  believe  that  Weber
would let such a good opportunity pass without doing some mischief.� Mari
  advised  him  to  write  Weber,  confronting  him  directly,  and  Einstein
reported back that he had. �He should at least know that he cannot do these
things  behind  my  back.  I  wrote  to  him  that  I  know  that  my  appointment
now depends on his report alone.�

It didn�t work. Einstein again got turned down. �Riecke�s rejection hasn�t
surprised me,� he wrote Mari . �I�m completely convinced that Weber is to
blame.� He became so discouraged that, at least for the moment, he felt it
futile to continue his search. �Under these circumstances it no longer makes
sense  to  write  further  to  professors,  since,  should  things  get  far  enough
along, it is certain they would all enquire with Weber, and he would again
give a poor reference.� To Grossmann he lamented, �I could have found a
job long ago had it not been for Weber�s underhandedness.�26

To  what  extent  did  anti-Semitism  play  a  role?  Einstein  came  to  believe
that it was a factor, which led him to seek work in Italy, where he felt it was

 
not  so  pronounced.  �One  of  the  main  obstacles  in  getting  a  position  is
absent here, namely anti-Semitism, which in German-speaking countries is
as unpleasant as it is a hindrance,� he wrote Mari . She, in turn, lamented to
her  friend  about  her  lover�s  difficulties.  �You  know  my  sweetheart  has  a
sharp tongue and moreover he is a Jew.�27

In his effort to find work in Italy, Einstein enlisted one of the friends he
had  made  while  studying  in  Zurich,  an  engineer  named  Michele  Angelo
Besso. Like Einstein, Besso was from a middle-class Jewish family that had
wandered  around  Europe  and  eventually  settled  in  Italy.  He  was  six  years
older than Einstein, and by the time they met he had already graduated from
the Polytechnic and was working for an engineering firm. He and Einstein
forged a close friendship that would last for the rest of their lives (they died
within weeks of each other in 1955).

Over  the  years,  Besso  and  Einstein  would  share  both  the  most  intimate
personal confidences and the loftiest scientific notions. As Einstein wrote in
one  of  the  229  extant  letters  they  exchanged,  �Nobody  else  is  so  close  to
me, nobody knows me so well, nobody is so kindly disposed to me as you
are.�28

Besso had a delightful intellect, but he lacked focus, drive, and diligence.
Like Einstein, he had once been asked to leave high school because of his
insubordinate attitude (he sent a petition complaining about a math teacher).
Einstein called Besso �an awful weakling . . . who cannot rouse himself to
any action in life or scientific creation, but who has an extraordinarily fine
mind whose working, though disorderly, I watch with great delight.�

Einstein had introduced Besso to Anna Winteler of Aarau, Marie�s sister,
whom  he  ended  up  marrying.  By  1901  he  had  moved  to  Trieste  with  her.
When Einstein caught up with him, he found Besso as smart, as funny, and
as maddeningly unfocused as ever. He had recently been asked by his boss
to inspect a power station, and he decided to leave the night before to make
sure that he arrived on time. But he missed his train, then failed to get there
the next day, and finally arrived on the third day��but to his horror realizes
that he has forgotten what he�s supposed to do.� So he sent a postcard back
to  the  office  asking  them  to  resend  his  instructions.  It  was  the  boss�s
assessment that Besso was �completely useless and almost unbalanced.�

Einstein�s  assessment  of  Besso  was  more  loving.  �Michele  is  an  awful
schlemiel,�  he  reported  to  Mari ,  using  the  Yiddish  word  for  a  hapless
bumbler. One evening, Besso and Einstein spent almost four hours talking

about  science,  including  the  properties  of  the  mysterious  ether  and  �the
definition  of absolute  rest.�These  ideas  would  burst into bloom four  years
later,  in  the  relativity  theory  that  he  would  devise  with  Besso  as  his
sounding  board.  �He�s  interested  in  our  research,�  Einstein  wrote  Mari ,
�though  he  often  misses  the  big  picture  by  worrying  about  petty
considerations.�

Besso  had  some  connections  that  could,  Einstein  hoped,  be  useful.  His
uncle  was  a  mathematics  professor  at  the  polytechnic  in  Milan,  and
Einstein�s plan was to have Besso provide an introduction: �I�ll grab him by
the  collar  and  drag  him  to  his  uncle,  where  I�ll  do  the  talking  myself.�
Besso  was  able  to  persuade  his  uncle  to  write  letters  on  Einstein�s  behalf,
but  nothing  came  of  the  effort.  Instead,  Einstein  spent  most  of  1901
juggling temporary teaching assignments and some tutoring.29

It was Einstein�s other close friend from Zurich, his classmate and math
note-taker Marcel Grossmann, who ended up finally getting Einstein a job,
though  not  one  that  would  have  been  expected.  Just  when  Einstein  was
beginning  to  despair,  Grossmann  wrote  that  there  was  likely  to  be  an
opening  for  an  examiner  at  the  Swiss  Patent  Office,  located  in  Bern.
Grossmann�s  father  knew  the  director  and  was  willing  to  recommend
Einstein.

�I was deeply moved by your devotion and compassion, which did not let
you forget your luckless friend,� Einstein replied. �I would be delighted to
get  such  a  nice  job  and  that  I  would  spare  no  effort  to  live  up  to  your
recommendation.�  To  Mari   he  exulted:  �Just  think  what  a  wonderful  job
this  would  be  for  me!  I�ll  be  mad  with  joy  if  something  should  come  of
that.�

It  would  take  months,  he  knew,  before  the  patent-office  job  would
materialize, assuming that it ever did. So he accepted a temporary post at a
technical  school  in  Winterthur  for  two  months,  filling  in  for  a  teacher  on
military leave. The hours would be long and, worse yet, he would have to
teach  descriptive  geometry,  neither  then  nor  later  his  strongest  field.  �But
the  valiant  Swabian  is  not  afraid,�  he  proclaimed,  repeating  one  of  his
favorite poetic phrases.30

In the meantime, he and Mari  would have the chance to take a romantic

vacation together, one that would have fateful consequences.

Lake Como, May 1901

�You absolutely must come see me in Como, you little witch,� Einstein
wrote Mari  at  the  end of April  1901.  �You�ll  see for  yourself how bright
and cheerful I�ve become and how all my brow-knitting is gone.�

The  family  disputes  and  frustrating  job  search  had  caused  him  to  be
snappish,  but  he  promised  that  was  now  over.  �It  was  only  out  of
nervousness that I was mean to you,� he apologized. To make it up to her,
he proposed that they should have a romantic and sensuous tryst in one of
the world�s most romantic and sensuous places: Lake Como, the grandest of
the  jewel-like  Alpine  finger  lakes  high  on  the  border  of  Italy  and
Switzerland, where in early May the lush foliage bursts forth under majestic
snow-capped peaks.

�Bring  my  blue  dressing-gown  so  we  can  wrap  ourselves  up  in  it,�  he

said. �I promise you an outing the likes of which you�ve never seen.�31

Mari   quickly  accepted,  but  then  changed  her  mind;  she  had  received  a
letter from her family in Novi Sad �that robs me of all desire, not only for
having  fun,  but  for  life  itself.�  He  should  make  the  trip  on  his  own,  she
sulked.�It seems I can have nothing without being punished.� But the next
day she changed her mind again. �I wrote you a little card yesterday while
in the worst of moods because of a letter I received. But when I read your
letter  today  I  became  a  bit  more  cheerful,  since  I  see  how  much  you  love
me, so I think we�ll take that trip after all.�32

And thus it was that early on the morning of Sunday, May 5, 1901, Albert
Einstein was waiting for Mileva Mari  at the train station in the village of
Como,  Italy,  �with  open  arms  and  a  pounding  heart.�  They  spent  the  day
there, admiring its gothic cathedral and walled old town, then took one of
the stately white steamers that hop from village to village along the banks
of the lake.

They stopped to visit Villa Carlotta, the most luscious of all the famous
mansions that dot the shore, with its frescoed ceilings, a version of Antonio
Canova�s  erotic  sculpture  Cupid  and  Psyche,  and  five  hundred  species  of
plants.  Mari   later  wrote  a  friend  how  much  she  admired  �the  splendid
garden,  which  I  preserved  in  my  heart,  the  more  so  because  we  were  not
allowed to swipe a single flower.�

 
After  spending  the  night  in  an  inn,  they  decided  to  hike  through  the
mountain pass to Switzerland, but found it still covered with up to twenty
feet  of  snow.  So  they  hired  a  small  sleigh,�the  kind  they  use  that  has  just
enough room for two people in love with each other, and a coachman stands
on a little plank in the rear and prattles all the time and calls you �signora,� �
Mari  wrote. �Could you think of anything more beautiful?�

The  snow  was  falling  merrily,  as  far  as  the  eye  could  see,  �so  that  this
cold, white infinity gave me the shivers and I held my sweetheart firmly in
my arms under the coats and shawls covering us.� On the way down, they
stomped  and  kicked  at  the  snow  to  produce  little  avalanches,  �so  as  to
properly scare the world below.�33

A few days later, Einstein recalled �how beautiful it was the last time you
let me press your dear little person against me in that most natural way.�34
And  in  that  most  natural  way,  Mileva  Mari   became  pregnant  with  Albert
Einstein�s child.

After returning to Winterthur, where he was a substitute teacher, Einstein
wrote  Mari   a  letter  that  made  reference  to  her  pregnancy.  Oddly�or
perhaps not oddly at all�he began by delving into matters scientific rather
than personal.�I just read a wonderful paper by Lenard on the generation of
cathode  rays  by  ultraviolet  light,�  he  started.  �Under  the  influence  of  this
beautiful  piece  I  am  filled  with  such  happiness  and  joy  that  I  must  share
some of it with you.� Einstein would soon revolutionize science by building
on  Lenard�s  paper  to  produce  a  theory  of  light  quanta  that  explained  this
photoelectric effect. Even so, it is rather surprising, or at least amusing, that
when  he  rhapsodized  about  sharing  �happiness  and  joy�  with  his  newly
pregnant lover, he was referring to a paper on beams of electrons.

Only  after  this  scientific  exultation  came  a  brief  reference  to  their
expected child, whom Einstein referred to as a boy: �How are you darling?
How�s  the  boy?�  He  went  on  to  display  an  odd  notion  of  what  parenting
would be like: �Can you imagine how pleasant it will be when we�re able to
work again, completely undisturbed, and with no one around to tell us what
to do!�

Most  of all, he tried  to  be reassuring.  He  would  find  a job,  he pledged,
even  if  it  meant  going  into  the  insurance  business.  They  would  create  a
comfortable home together. �Be happy and don�t fret, darling. I won�t leave
you  and  will  bring  everything  to  a  happy  conclusion.  You  just  have  to  be

patient! You will see that my arms are not so bad to rest in, even if things
are beginning a little awkwardly.�35

Mari  was preparing to retake her graduation exams, and she was hoping
to go on to get a doctorate and become a physicist. Both she and her parents
had  invested  enormous  amounts,  emotionally  and  financially,  in  that  goal
over  the  years.  She  could  have,  if  she  had  wished,  terminated  her
pregnancy. Zurich was then a center of a burgeoning birth control industry,
which included a mail-order abortion drug firm based there.

Instead,  she  decided  that  she  wanted  to  have  Einstein�s  child�even
though he was not yet ready or willing to marry her. Having a child out of
wedlock  was  rebellious,  given  their  upbringings,  but  not  uncommon.  The
official  statistics  for  Zurich  in  1901  show  that  12  percent  of  births  were
illegitimate. Residents who were Austro-Hungarian, moreover, were much
more  likely  to  get  pregnant  while  unmarried.  In  southern  Hungary,  33
percent of births were illegitimate. Serbs had the highest rate of illegitimate
births, Jews by far the lowest.36

The  decision  caused  Einstein  to  focus  on  the  future.  �I  will  look  for  a
position  immediately,  no  matter  how  humble  it  is,�  he  told  her.  �My
scientific goals and my personal vanity will not prevent me from accepting
even  the  most  subordinate  position.�  He  decided  to  call  Besso�s  father  as
well  as  the  director  of  the  local  insurance  company,  and  he  promised  to
marry her as soon as he settled into a job. �Then no one can cast a stone on
your dear little head.�

The pregnancy could also resolve, or so he hoped, the issues they faced
with their families. �When your parents and mine are presented with a fait
accompli, they�ll just have to reconcile themselves to it as best they can.�37
Mari ,  bedridden  in  Zurich  with  pregnancy  sickness,  was  thrilled.  �So,
sweetheart, you want to look for a job immediately? And have me move in
with  you!�  It  was  a  vague  proposal,  but  she  immediately  pronounced
herself  �happy�  to  agree.  �Of  course  it  mustn�t  involve  accepting  a  really
bad position,  darling,�  she added. �That  would  make  me  feel terrible.�  At
her sister�s suggestion she tried to convince Einstein to visit her parents in
Serbia for the summer vacation. �It would make me so happy,� she begged.
�And  when  my  parents  see  the  two  of  us  physically  in  front  of  them,  all
their doubts will evaporate.�38

But Einstein, to her dismay, decided to spend the summer vacation again
with his mother and sister in the Alps. As a result, he was not there to help

and  encourage  her  at  the  end  of  July  1901  when  she  re-took  her  exams.
Perhaps as a consequence of her pregnancy and personal situation, Mileva
ended up failing for the second time, once again getting a 4.0 out of 6 and
once again being the only one in her group not to pass.

Thus  it  was  that  Mileva  Mari   found  herself  resigned  to  giving  up  her
dream of being a scientific scholar. She visited her home in Serbia�alone
�and  told  her  parents  about  her  academic  failure  and  her  pregnancy.
Before leaving, she asked Einstein to send her father a letter describing their
plans and, presumably, pledging to marry her. �Will you send me the letter
so I can see what you�ve written?� she asked. �By and by I�ll give him the
necessary information, the unpleasant news as well.�39

Disputes with Drude and Others

Einstein�s  impudence  and  contempt  for  convention,  traits  that  were
abetted by Mari , were evident in his science as well as in his personal life
in 1901. That year, the unemployed enthusiast engaged in a series of tangles
with academic authorities.

The squabbles show that Einstein had no qualms about challenging those
in  power.  In  fact,  it  seemed  to  infuse  him  with  glee.  As  he  proclaimed  to
Jost  Winteler  in  the  midst  of  his  disputes  that  year,  �Blind  respect  for
authority is the greatest enemy of truth.� It would prove a worthy credo, one
suitable for being carved on his coat of arms if he had ever wanted such a
thing.

His  struggles  that  year  also  reveal  something  more  subtle  about
Einstein�s  scientific  thinking:  he  had  an  urge�indeed,  a  compulsion�to
unify concepts from different branches of physics. �It is a glorious feeling
to  discover  the  unity  of  a  set  of  phenomena  that  seem  at  first  to  be
completely separate,� he wrote to his friend Grossmann as he embarked that
spring on an attempt to tie his work on capillarity to Boltzmann�s theory of
gases. That sentence, more than any other, sums up the faith that underlay
Einstein�s  scientific  mission,  from  his  first  paper  until  his  last  scribbled
field equations, guiding him with the same sure sense that was displayed by
the needle of his childhood compass.40

Among the potentially unifying concepts that were mesmerizing Einstein,
and much of the physics world, were those that sprang from kinetic theory,

 
which  had  been  developed  in  the  late  nineteenth  century  by  applying  the
principles  of  mechanics  to  phenomena  such  as  heat  transfer  and  the
behavior  of  gases.  This  involved  regarding  a  gas,  for  example,  as  a
collection of a huge number of tiny particles�in this case, molecules made
up  of  one  or  more  atoms�that  careen  around  freely  and  occasionally
collide with one another.

Kinetic  theory  spurred  the  growth  of  statistical  mechanics,  which
describes  the  behavior  of  a  large  number  of  particles  using  statistical
calculations. It was, of course, impossible to trace each molecule and each
collision  in  a  gas,  but  knowing  the  statistical  behavior  gave  a  workable
theory of how billions of molecules behaved under varying conditions.

Scientists proceeded to apply these concepts not only to the behavior of
gases, but also to phenomena that occurred in liquids and solids, including
electrical  conductivity  and  radiation.  �The  opportunity  arose  to  apply  the
methods of the kinetic theory of gases to completely different branches of
physics,�  Einstein�s  close  friend  Paul  Ehrenfest,  himself  an  expert  in  the
field,  later  wrote.�Above  all,  the  theory  was  applied  to  the  motion  of
electrons  in  metals,  to  the  Brownian  motion  of  microscopically  small
particles in suspensions, and to the theory of blackbody radiation.�41

Although  many  scientists  were  using  atomism  to  explore  their  own
specialties,  for  Einstein  it  was  a  way  to  make  connections,  and  develop
unifying  theories,  between  a  variety  of  disciplines.  In  April  1901,  for
example,  he  adapted  the  molecular  theories  he  had  used  to  explain  the
capillary  effect  in  liquids  and  applied  them  to  the  diffusion  of  gas
molecules. �I�ve got an extremely lucky idea, which will make it possible to
apply our theory of molecular forces to gases as well,� he wrote Mari . To
Grossmann  he  noted,  �I  am  now  convinced  that  my  theory  of  atomic
attractive forces can also be extended to gases.�42

Next  he  became  interested  in  the  conduction  of  heat  and  electricity,
which  led  him  to  study  Paul  Drude�s  electron  theory  of  metals.  As  the
Einstein  scholar  J�rgen  Renn  notes,  �Drude�s  electron  theory  and
Boltzmann�s  kinetic  theory  of  gas  do  not  just  happen  to  be  two  arbitrary
subjects of interest to Einstein, but rather they share an important common
property  with  several  other  of  his  early  research  topics:  they  are  two
examples  of  the  application  of  atomistic  ideas  to  physical  and  chemical
problems.�43

Drude�s electron theory posited that there are particles in metal that move
freely, as molecules of gas do, and thereby conduct both heat and electricity.
When  Einstein  looked  into  it,  he  was  pleased  with  it  in  parts.  �I  have  a
study in my hands by Paul Drude on the electron theory, which is written to
my heart�s desire, even though it contains some very sloppy things,� he told
Mari .  A  month  later,  with  his  usual  lack  of  deference  to  authority,  he
declared, �Perhaps I�ll write to Drude privately to point out his mistakes.�

And so he did. In a letter to Drude in June,Einstein pointed out what he
thought were two mistakes.�He will hardly have anything sensible to refute
me  with,�  Einstein  gloated  to  Mari ,  �because  my  objections  are  very
straightforward.�  Perhaps  under  the  charming  illusion  that  showing  an
eminent  scientist  his  purported  lapses  is  a  good  method  for  getting  a  job,
Einstein included a request for one in his letter.44

Surprisingly,  Drude  replied.  Not  surprisingly,  he  dismissed  Einstein�s
objections.  Einstein  was  outraged.  �It  is  such  manifest  proof  of  the
wretchedness  of  its  author  that  no  further  comment  by  me  is  necessary,�
Einstein  said  when  forwarding  Drude�s  reply  to  Mari .  �From  now on I�ll
no  longer  turn  to  such  people,  and  will  instead  attack  them  mercilessly  in
the journals, as they deserve. It is no wonder that little by little one becomes
a misanthrope.�

Einstein also vented his frustration to Jost Winteler, his father figure from
Aarau,  in  a  letter  that  included  his  declaration  about  a  blind  respect  for
authority  being  the  greatest  enemy  of  truth.  �He  responds  by  pointing  out
that another �infallible� colleague of his shares his opinion. I�ll soon make it
hot for the man with a masterly publication.�45

The  published  papers  of  Einstein  do  not  identify  this  �infallible�
colleague cited by Drude, but some sleuthing by Renn has turned up a letter
from Mari   that declares  it to  be Ludwig  Boltzmann.46  That  explains  why
Einstein  proceeded  to  immerse  himself  in  Boltzmann�s  writings.  �I  have
been  engrossed  in  Boltzmann�s  works  on  the  kinetic  theory  of  gases,�  he
wrote  Grossmann  in  September,  �and  these  last  few  days  I  wrote  a  short
paper myself that provides the missing key-stone in the chain of proofs that
he started.�47

Boltzmann,  then  at  the  University  of  Leipzig,  was  Europe�s  master  of
statistical physics. He had helped to develop the kinetic theory and defend
the  faith  that  atoms  and  molecules  actually  exist.  In  doing  so,  he  found  it
necessary  to  reconceive  the  great  Second  Law  of  Thermodynamics.  This

law has many equivalent formulations. It says that heat flows naturally from
hot to cold, but not the reverse. Another way to describe the Second Law is
in terms of entropy, the degree of disorder and randomness in a system. Any
spontaneous process tends to increase the entropy of a system. For example,
perfume molecules drift out of an open bottle and into a room but don�t, at
least in our common experience, spontaneously gather themselves together
and all drift back into the bottle.

The  problem  for  Boltzmann  was  that  mechanical  processes,  such  as
molecules bumping around, could each be reversed, according to Newton.
So a spontaneous decrease in entropy would, at least in theory, be possible.
The  absurdity  of  positing  that  diffused  perfume  molecules  could  gather
back  into  a  bottle,  or  that  heat  could  flow  from  a  cold  body  to  a  hot  one
spontaneously, was flung against Boltzmann by opponents, such as Wilhelm
Ostwald,  who  did  not  believe  in  the  reality  of  atoms  and  molecules.  �The
proposition  that  all  natural  phenomena  can  ultimately  be  reduced  to
mechanical ones cannot even be taken as a useful working hypothesis: it is
simply  a  mistake,�  Ostwald  declared.  �The  irreversibility  of  natural
phenomena  proves  the  existence  of  processes  that  cannot  be  described  by
mechanical equations.�

Boltzmann  responded  by  revising  the  Second  Law  so  that  it  was  not
absolute but merely a statistical near-certainty. It was theoretically possible
that millions of perfume molecules could randomly bounce around in a way
that they all put themselves back into a bottle at a certain moment, but that
was  exceedingly  unlikely,  perhaps  trillions  of  times  less  likely  than  that  a
new  deck  of  cards  shuffled  a  hundred  times  would  end  up  back  in  its
pristine rank-and-suit precise order.48

When  Einstein  rather  immodestly  declared  in  September  1901  that  he
was filling in a �keystone� that was missing in Boltzmann�s chain of proofs,
he  said  he  planned  to  publish  it  soon.  But  first,  he  sent  a  paper  to  the
Annalen  der  Physik  that  involved  an  electrical  method  for  investigating
molecular forces, which used calculations derived from experiments others
had done using salt solutions and an electrode.49

Then  he  published  his  critique  of  Boltzmann�s  theories.  He  noted  that
they worked well in explaining heat transfer in gases but had not yet been
properly  generalized  for  other  realms.  �Great  as  the  achievements  of  the
kinetic theory of heat have been in the domain of gas theory,� he wrote, �the
science  of  mechanics  has  not  yet  been  able  to  produce  an  adequate

foundation  for  the  general  theory  of  heat.�  His  aim  was  �to  close  this
gap.�50

This  was  all  quite  presumptuous  for  an  undistinguished  Polytechnic
student  who  had  not  been  able  to  get  either  a  doctorate  or  a  job.  Einstein
himself later admitted that these papers added little to the body of physics
wisdom. But they do indicate what was at the heart of his 1901 challenges
to  Drude  and  Boltzmann.  Their  theories,  he  felt,  did  not  live  up  to  the
maxim  he  had  proclaimed  to  Grossmann  earlier  that  year  about  how
glorious it was to discover an underlying unity in a set of phenomena that
seem completely separate.

In the meantime, in November 1901, Einstein had submitted an attempt
at  a  doctoral  dissertation  to  Professor  Alfred  Kleiner  at  the  University  of
Zurich.  The  dissertation  has  not  survived,  but  Mari   told  a  friend  that  �it
deals with research into the molecular forces in gases using various known
phenomena.�  Einstein  was  confident.  �He  won�t  dare  reject  my
dissertation,� he said of Kleiner, �otherwise the shortsighted man is of little
use to me.�51

By  December  Kleiner  had  not  even  responded,  and  Einstein  started
worrying  that  perhaps  the  professor�s  �fragile  dignity�  might  make  him
uncomfortable  accepting  a  dissertation  that  denigrated  the  work  of  such
masters as Drude and Boltzmann. �If he dares to reject my dissertation, then
I�ll  publish  his  rejection  along  with  my  paper  and  make  a  fool  of  him,�
Einstein said. �But if he accepts it, then we�ll see what good old Herr Drude
has to say.�

Eager  for  a  resolution,  he  decided  to  go  see  Kleiner  personally.  Rather
surprisingly,  the  meeting  went  well.  Kleiner  admitted  he  had  not  yet  read
the dissertation, and Einstein told him to take his time. They then proceeded
to discuss various ideas that Einstein was developing, some of which would
eventually bear fruit in his relativity theory. Kleiner promised Einstein that
he could count on him for a recommendation the next time a teaching job
came  up.  �He�s  not  quite  as  stupid  as  I�d  thought,�  was  Einstein�s
verdict.�Moreover, he�s a good fellow.�52

Kleiner  may  have  been  a  good  fellow,  but  he  did  not  like  Einstein�s
dissertation when he finally got around to reading it. In particular, he was
unhappy  about  Einstein�s  attack  on  the  scientific  establishment.  So  he
rejected it; more precisely, he told Einstein to withdraw it voluntarily, which
permitted him to get back his 230 franc fee. According to a book written by

Einstein�s stepson-in-law, Kleiner�s action was �out of consideration to his
colleague  Ludwig  Boltzmann,  whose  train  of  reasoning  Einstein  had
sharply  criticized.�  Einstein,  lacking  such  sensitivity,  was  persuaded  by  a
friend to send the attack directly to Boltzmann.53

Lieserl

Marcel Grossmann had mentioned to Einstein that there was likely to be
a  job  at  the  patent  office  for  him,  but  it  had  not  yet  materialized.  So  five
months  later,  he  gently  reminded  Grossmann  that  he  still  needed  help.
Noticing  in  the  newspaper  that  Grossmann  had  won  a  job  teaching  at  a
Swiss  high  school,  Einstein  expressed  his  �great  joy�  and  then  plaintively
added, �I, too, applied for that position, but I did it only so that I wouldn�t
have to tell myself that I was too faint-hearted to apply.�54

In the fall of 1901, Einstein took an even humbler job as a tutor at a little
private academy in Schaffhausen, a village on the Rhine twenty miles north
of  Zurich.  The  work  consisted  solely  of  tutoring  a  rich  English  schoolboy
who was there. To be taught by Einstein would someday seem a bargain at
any price. But at the time, the proprietor of the school, Jacob N�esch, was
getting the bargain. He was charging the child�s family 4,000 francs a year,
while  paying  Einstein  only  150  francs  a  month,  plus  providing  room  and
board.

Einstein continued to promise Mari  that she would �get a good husband
as  soon  as  this  becomes  feasible,�  but  he  was  now  despairing  about  the
patent job. �The position in Bern has not yet been advertised so that I am
really giving up hope for it.�55

Mari  was eager to be with him, but her pregnancy made it impossible for
them  to  be  together  in  public.  So  she  spent  most  of  November  at  a  small
hotel  in  a  neighboring  village.  Their  relationship  was  becoming  strained.
Despite  her  pleas,  Einstein  came  only  infrequently  to  visit  her,  often
claiming that he did not have the spare money. �You�ll surely surprise me,
right?�  she  begged  after  getting  yet  another  note  canceling  a  visit.  Her
pleadings and anger alternated, often in the same letter:

If you only knew how terribly homesick I am, you would surely come.
Are you really out of money? That�s nice! The man earns 150 francs,

 
has room and board provided, and at the end of the month doesn�t have
a cent to his name! ... Don�t use that as an excuse for Sunday, please. If
you don�t get any money by then, I will send you some . . . If you only
knew  how  much  I  want  to  see  you  again!  I  think  about  you  all  day
long, and even more at night.56

Einstein�s  impatience  with  authority  soon  pitted  him  against  the
proprietor of the academy. He tried to cajole his tutee to move to Bern with
him and pay him directly, but the boy�s mother balked. Then Einstein asked
N�esch to give him his meal money in cash so that he would not have to eat
with  his  family.  �You  know  what  our  conditions  are,�  N�esch  replied.
�There is no reason to deviate from them.�

A  surly  Einstein  threatened  to  find  new  arrangements,  and  N�esch
backed down in a rage. In a line that could be considered yet another maxim
for his life, Einstein recounted the scene to Mari   and exulted,  �Long  live
impudence! It is my guardian angel in this world.�

That night, as he sat down for his last meal at the N�esch household, he
found  a  letter  for  him  next  to  his  soup  plate.  It  was  from  his  real-life
guardian  angel,  Marcel  Grossmann.  The  position  at  the  patent  office,
Grossmann wrote, was about to be advertised, and Einstein was sure to get
it. Their lives were soon to be �brilliantly changed for the better,� an excited
Einstein wrote Mari . �I�m dizzy with joy when I think about it,� he said.
�I�m  even  happier  for  you  than  for  myself.  Together  we�d  surely  be  the
happiest people on the earth.�

That still left the issue of what to do about their baby, who was due to be
born in less than two months, by early February 1902. �The only problem
that would remain to be solved would be how to keep our Lieserl with us,�
Einstein (who had begun referring to their unborn child as a girl) wrote to
Mari ,  who  had  returned  home  to  have  the  baby  at  her  parents�  house  in
Novi Sad. �I wouldn�t want to have to give her up.� It was a noble intention
on  his  part,  yet  he  knew  that  it  would  be  difficult  for  him  to  show  up  for
work  in  Bern  with  an  illegitimate  child.  �Ask  your  Papa;  he�s  an
experienced  man,  and  knows  the  world  better  than  your  overworked,
impractical  Johnnie.�  For  good  measure,  he  declared  that  the  baby,  when
born,  �shouldn�t  be  stuffed  with  cow  milk,  because  it  might  make  her
stupid.� Mari �s milk would be more nourishing, he said.57

 
Although  he  was  willing  to  consult  Mari �s  family,  Einstein  had  no
intention of letting his own family know that his mother�s worst fears about
his  relationship�a  pregnancy  and  possible  marriage�were  materializing.
His sister seemed to realize that he and Mari  were secretly planning to be
married, and she told this to members of the Winteler family in Aarau. But
none  of  them  showed  any  sign  of  suspecting  that  a  child  was  involved.
Einstein�s  mother  learned  about  the  purported  engagement  from  Mrs.
Winteler.  �We  are  resolutely  against  Albert�s  relationship  with  Fraulein
Mari ,  and  we  don�t  ever  wish  to  have  anything  to  do  with  her,�  Pauline
Einstein lamented.58

Einstein�s  mother  even  took  the  extraordinary  step  of  writing  a  nasty
letter,  signed  also  by  her  husband,  to  Mari �s  parents.  �This  lady,�  Mari
lamented to a friend about Einstein�s mother, �seems to have set as her life�s
goal  to  embitter  as  much  as  possible  not  only  my  life  but  also  that  of  her
son. I could not have thought it possible that there could exist such heartless
and  outright  wicked  people!  They  felt  no  compunctions  about  writing  a
letter  to  my  parents  in  which  they  reviled  me  in  a  manner  that  was  a
disgrace.�59

The  official  advertisement  announcing  the  patent  office  opportunity
finally  appeared  in  December  1901.  The  director,  Friedrich  Haller,
apparently  tailored  the  specifications  so  that  Einstein  would  get  the  job.
Candidates  did  not  need  a  doctorate,  but  they  must  have  mechanical
training  and  also  know  physics.  �Haller  put  this  in  for  my  sake,�  Einstein
told Mari .

Haller  wrote  Einstein  a  friendly  letter  making  it  clear  that  he  was  the
prime  candidate,  and  Grossmann  called  to  congratulate  him.  �There�s  no
doubt anymore,� Einstein exulted to Mari . �Soon you�ll be my happy little
wife,  just  watch.  Now  our  troubles  are  over.  Only  now  that  this  terrible
weight is off my shoulders do I realize how much I love you... Soon I�ll be
able to take my Dollie in my arms and call her my own in front of the whole
world.�60

He made her promise, however, that marriage would not turn them into a
comfortable  bourgeois  couple:  �We�ll  diligently  work  on  science  together
so  we  don�t  become  old  philistines,  right?�  Even  his  sister,  he  felt,  was
becoming �so crass� in her approach to creature comforts. �You�d better not
get that way,� he told Mari . �It would be terrible. You must always be my

witch and street urchin. Everyone but you seems foreign to me, as if they
were separated from me by an invisible wall.�

In  anticipation  of  getting  the  patent-office  job,  Einstein  abandoned  the
student  he  had  been  tutoring  in  Schaffhausen  and  moved  to  Bern  in  late
January  1902.  He  would  be  forever  grateful  to  Grossmann,  whose  aid
would  continue  in  different  ways  over  the  next  few  years.  �Grossmann  is
doing  his  dissertation  on  a  subject  that  is  related  to  non-Euclidean
geometry,� Einstein noted to Mari . �I don�t know exactly what it is.�61

A  few  days  after  Einstein  arrived  in  Bern,  Mileva  Mari ,  staying  at  her
parents� home in Novi Sad, gave birth to their baby, a girl whom they called
Lieserl. Because the childbirth was so difficult, Mari  was unable to write to
him. Her father sent Einstein the news.

�Is she healthy, and does she cry properly?� Einstein wrote Mari . �What
are her eyes like? Which one of us does she more resemble? Who is giving
her milk? Is she hungry? She must be completely bald. I love her so much
and  don�t  even  know  her  yet!�  Yet  his  love  for  their  new  baby  seemed  to
exist  mainly  in  the  abstract,  for  it  was  not  quite  enough  to  induce  him  to
make the train trip to Novi Sad.62

Einstein did not tell his mother, sister, or any of his friends about the birth
of  Lieserl.  In  fact,  there  is  no  indication  that  he  ever  told  them  about  her.
Never  once  did  he  publicly  speak  of  her  or  acknowledge  that  she  even
existed. No mention of her survives in any correspondence, except for a few
letters  between Einstein  and Mari ,  and these  were  suppressed  and hidden
until  1986,  when  scholars  and  the  editors  of  his  papers  were  completely
surprised to learn of Lieserl�s existence.*

But in his letter to Mari  right after Lieserl�s birth, the baby brought out
Einstein�s  wry  side.  �She�s  certainly  able  to  cry  already,  but  won�t  know
how to laugh until much later,� he said. �Therein lies a profound truth.�

Fatherhood also focused him on the need to make some money while he
waited  to  get  the  patent-office  job.  So  the  next  day  an  ad  appeared  in  the
newspaper:  �Private  lessons  in  Mathematics  and  Physics  .  .  .  given  most
thoroughly  by  Albert  Einstein,  holder  of  the  federal  Polytechnic  teacher�s
diploma ... Trial lessons free.�

Lieserl�s birth even caused Einstein to display a domestic, nesting instinct
not previously apparent. He found a large room in Bern and drew for Mari
a  sketch  of  it,  complete  with  diagrams  showing  the  bed,  six  chairs,  three
cabinets,  himself  (�Johnnie�),  and  a  couch  marked  �look  at  that!�63
However, Mari  was not going to be moving into it with him. They were not
married, and an aspiring Swiss civil servant could not be seen cohabitating
in such a way. Instead, after a few months, Mari  moved back to Zurich to
wait  for  him  to  get  a  job  and,  as  promised,  marry  her.  She  did  not  bring
Lieserl with her.

Einstein  and his  daughter apparently  never  laid eyes on each other.  She
would  merit,  as  we  shall  see,  just  one  brief  mention  in  their  surviving
correspondence less than two years later, in September 1903, and then not
be referred to again. In the meantime, she was left back in Novi Sad with
her  mother�s  relatives  or  friends  so  that  Einstein  could  maintain  both  his
unencumbered  lifestyle  and  the  bourgeois  respectability  he  needed  to
become a Swiss official.

There is a cryptic hint that the person who took custody of Lieserl may
have been Mari �s close friend, Helene Kaufler Savi , whom she had met in
1899 when they lived in the same rooming house in Zurich. Savi  was from
a Viennese Jewish family and had married an engineer from Serbia in 1900.
During her pregnancy, Mari  had written her a letter pouring out all of her
woes, but she tore it up before mailing it. She was glad she had done so, she
explained  to  Einstein  two  months  before  Lieserl�s  birth,  because  �I  don�t
think we should say anything about Lieserl yet.� Mari  added that Einstein
should write Savi  a few words now and then. �We must now treat her very
nicely. She�ll have to help us in something important, after all.�64

The Patent Office

 
 
As he was waiting to be offered the job at the patent office, Einstein ran
into  an  acquaintance  who  was  working  there.  The  job  was  boring,  the
person complained, and he noted that the position Einstein was waiting to
get was �the lowest rank,� so at least he didn�t have to worry that anyone
else  would  apply  for  it.  Einstein  was  unfazed.  �Certain  people  find
everything boring,� Einstein told Mari . As for the disdain about being on
the  lowest  rung,  Einstein  told  her  that  they  should  feel  just  the  opposite:
�We couldn�t care less about being on top!�65

The  job  finally  came  through  on  June  16,  1902,  when  a  session  of  the
Swiss  Council  officially  elected  him  �provisionally  as  a  Technical  Expert
Class 3 of the Federal Office for Intellectual Property with an annual salary
of  3,500  francs,�  which  was  actually  more  than  what  a  junior  professor
would make.66

His  office  in  Bern�s  new  Postal  and  Telegraph  Building  was  near  the
world-famous clock tower over the old city gate (see p. 107). As he turned
left out of his apartment on his way to work, Einstein walked past it every
day.  The  clock  was  originally  built  shortly  after  the  city  was  founded  in
1191, and an astronomical contraption featuring the positions of the planets
was added in 1530. Every hour, the clock would put on its show: out would
come  a  dancing  jester  ringing  bells,  then  a  parade  of  bears,  a  crowing
rooster,  and  an  armored  knight,  followed  by  Father  Time  with  his  scepter
and hourglass.

The clock was the official timekeeper for the nearby train station, the one
from  which  all  of  the  other  clocks  that  lined  the  platform  were
synchronized. The moving trains arriving from other cities, where the local
time was not always standardized, would reset their own clocks by looking
up at the Bern clock tower as they sped into town.67

So it was that Albert Einstein would end up spending the most creative
seven years of his life�even after he had written the papers that reoriented
physics�arriving at work at 8 a.m., six days a week, and examining patent
applications. �I am frightfully busy,� he wrote a friend a few months later.
�Every day I spend eight hours at the office and at least one hour of private
lessons, and then, in addition, I do some scientific work.� Yet it would be
wrong  to  think  that  poring  over  applications  for  patents  was  drudgery.  �I
enjoy  my  work  at  the  office  very  much,  because  it  is  uncommonly
diversified.�68

He soon learned that he could work on the patent applications so quickly
that  it  left  time  for  him  to  sneak  in  his  own  scientific  thinking  during  the
day.  �I  was  able  to  do  a  full  day�s  work  in  only  two  or  three  hours,�  he
recalled. �The remaining part of the day, I would work out my own ideas.�
His boss, Friedrich Haller, was a man of good-natured, growling skepticism
and genial humor who graciously ignored the sheets of paper that cluttered
Einstein�s desk and vanished into his drawer when people came to see him.
�Whenever anybody would come by, I would cram my notes into my desk
drawer and pretend to work on my office work.�69

Indeed, we should not feel sorry for Einstein that he found himself exiled
from the  cloisters  of academe. He  came  to  believe  that it was  a benefit  to
his  science, rather than  a burden, to  work  instead  in  �that  worldly  cloister
where I hatched my most beautiful ideas.�70

Every  day,  he  would  do  thought  experiments  based  on  theoretical
premises,  sniffing  out  the  underlying  realities.  Focusing  on  real-life
questions, he later said,�stimulated me to see the physical ramifications of
theoretical concepts.�71 Among the ideas that he had to consider for patents
were  dozens  of  new  methods  for  synchronizing  clocks  and  coordinating
time through signals sent at the speed of light.72

In addition, his boss Haller had a credo that was as useful for a creative
and rebellious theorist as it was for a patent examiner: �You have to remain
critically  vigilant.�  Question  every  premise,  challenge  conventional
wisdom, and never accept the truth of something merely because everyone
else  views  it  as  obvious.  Resist  being  credulous.  �When  you  pick  up  an
application,�  Haller  instructed,  �think  that  everything  the  inventor  says  is
wrong.�73

Einstein had grown up in a family that created patents and tried to apply
them in business, and he found the process to be fulfilling. It reinforced one
of his ingenious talents: the ability to conduct thought experiments in which
he could visualize how a theory would play out in practice. It also helped
him peel off the irrelevant facts that surrounded a problem.74

Had he been consigned instead to the job of an assistant to a professor, he
might  have  felt  compelled  to  churn  out  safe  publications  and  be  overly
cautious in challenging accepted notions. As he later noted, originality and
creativity  were  not  prime  assets  for  climbing  academic  ladders,  especially
in the German-speaking world, and he would have felt pressure to conform
to the prejudices or prevailing wisdom of his patrons. �An academic career

in which a person is forced to produce scientific writings in great amounts
creates a danger of intellectual superficiality,� he said.75

As  a  result,  the  happenstance  that  landed  him  on  a  stool  at  the  Swiss
Patent Office, rather than as an acolyte in academia, likely reinforced some
of  the  traits  destined  to  make  him  successful:  a  merry  skepticism  about
what  appeared  on  the  pages  in  front  of  him  and  an  independence  of
judgment that allowed him to challenge basic assumptions. There were no
pressures or incentives among the patent examiners to behave otherwise.

The Olympia Academy

Maurice Solovine, a Romanian studying philosophy at the University of
Bern, bought a newspaper while on a stroll one day during Easter vacation
of  1902  and  noticed  Einstein�s  advertisement  offering  tutorials  in  physics
(�trial  lessons  free�).  A  dapper  dilettante  with  close-cropped  hair  and  a
raffish goatee, Solovine was four years older than Einstein, but he had yet
to decide whether he wanted to be a philosopher, a physicist, or something
else.  So  he  went  to  the  address,  rang  the  bell,  and  a  moment  later  a  loud
voice thundered �In here!� Einstein made an immediate impression. �I was
struck by the extraordinary brilliance of his large eyes,� Solovine recalled.76
Their  first  discussion  lasted  almost  two  hours,  after  which  Einstein
followed  Solovine  into  the  street,  where  they  talked  for  a  half-hour  more.
They agreed to meet the next day. At the third session, Einstein announced
that conversing freely was more fun than tutoring for pay. �You don�t have
to be tutored in physics,� he said. �Just come see me when you want and I
will  be  glad  to  talk  with  you.�  They  decided  to  read  the  great  thinkers
together and then discuss their ideas.

Their sessions were joined by Conrad Habicht, a banker�s son and former
student  of  mathematics  at  the  Zurich  Polytechnic.  Poking  a  little  fun  at
pompous  scholarly  societies, 
the  Olympia
Academy.  Einstein,  even  though  he  was  the  youngest,  was  designated  the
president, and Solovine prepared a certificate with a drawing of an Einstein
bust  in  profile  beneath  a  string  of  sausages.  �A  man  perfectly  and  clearly
erudite, imbued with exquisite, subtle and elegant knowledge, steeped in the
revolutionary science of the cosmos,� the dedication declared.77

they  dubbed 

themselves 

 
Generally  their  dinners  were  frugal  repasts  of  sausage,  Gruy�re  cheese,
fruit, and tea. But for Einstein�s birthday, Solovine and Habicht decided to
surprise  him  by  putting  three  plates  of  caviar  on  the  table.  Einstein  was
engrossed  in  analyzing  Galileo�s  principle  of  inertia,  and  as  he  talked  he
took  mouthful  after  mouthful  of  his  caviar  without  seeming  to  notice.
Habicht  and  Solovine  exchanged  furtive  glances.  �Do  you  realize  what
you�ve been eating?� Solovine finally asked.

�For  goodness�  sake,�  Einstein  exclaimed.  �So  that  was  the  famous
caviar!� He paused for a moment, then added, �Well, if you offer gourmet
food to peasants like me, you know they won�t appreciate it.�

After  their  discussions,  which  could  last  all  night,  Einstein  would
sometimes  play  the  violin  and,  in  the  summertime,  they  occasionally
climbed  a  mountain  on  the  outskirts  of  Bern  to  watch  the  sunrise.  �The
sight  of  the  twinkling  stars  made  a  strong  impression  on  us  and  led  to
discussions of astronomy,� Solovine recalled. �We would marvel at the sun
as  it  came  slowly  toward  the  horizon  and  finally  appeared  in  all  of  its
splendor to bathe the Alps in a mystic rose.� Then they would wait for the
mountain caf� to open so they could drink dark coffee before hiking down
to start work.

Solovine once skipped a session scheduled for his apartment because he
was enticed instead to a concert by a Czech quartet. As a peace offering he
left behind, as his note written in Latin proclaimed, �hard boiled eggs and a
salutation.�  Einstein  and  Habicht,  knowing  how  much  Solovine  hated
tobacco, took revenge by smoking pipes and cigars in Solovine�s room and
piling his furniture and dishes on the bed. �Thick smoke and a salutation,�
they  wrote  in  Latin.  Solovine  says  he  was  �almost  overwhelmed�  by  the
fumes when he returned.�I thought I would suffocate. I opened the window
wide and began to remove from the bed the mound of things that reached
almost to the ceiling.�78

Solovine  and  Habicht  would  become  Einstein�s  lifelong  friends,  and  he
would later reminisce with them about �our cheerful �Academy,� which was
less childish than those respectable ones which I later got to know at close
quarters.�  In  response  to  a  joint  postcard  sent  from  Paris  by  his  two
colleagues  on  his  seventy-fourth  birthday,  he  paid  tribute  to  it:  �Your
members  created  you  to  make  fun  of  your  long-established  sister
Academies.  How  well  their  mockery  hit  the  mark  I  have  learned  to
appreciate fully through long years of careful observation.�79

The  Academy�s  reading  list  included  some  classics  with  themes  that
Einstein  could  appreciate,  such  as  Sophocles�  searing  play  about  the
defiance of authority, Antigone, and Cervantes� epic about stubbornly tilting
at  windmills, Don Quixote. But mostly  the  three academicians  read  books
that explored the  intersection of science and philosophy:  David Hume�s A
Treatise  of  Human  Nature,  Ernst  Mach�s  Analysis  of  the  Sensations  and
Mechanics  and  Its  Development,  Baruch  Spinoza�s  Ethics,  and  Henri
Poincar�s Science and Hypothesis.80 It was from reading these authors that
the young patent examiner began to develop his own philosophy of science.
The  most  influential  of  these,  Einstein  later  said,  was  the  Scottish
empiricist  David  Hume  (1711�1776).  In  the  tradition  of  Locke  and
Berkeley, Hume was skeptical about any knowledge other than what could
be  directly  perceived  by  the  senses.  Even  the  apparent  laws  of  causality
were  suspect  to  him,  mere  habits  of  the  mind;  a  ball  hitting  another  may
behave  the  way  that  Newton�s  laws  predict  time  after  time  after  time,  yet
that was not, strictly speaking, a reason to believe that it would happen that
way  the  next  time.  �Hume  saw  clearly  that  certain  concepts,  for  example
that of causality, cannot be deduced from our perceptions of experience by
logical methods,� Einstein noted.

A  version  of  this  philosophy,  sometimes  called  positivism,  denied  the
validity  of any concepts that went beyond descriptions  of phenomena  that
we directly experience. It appealed to Einstein, at least initially. �The theory
of relativity suggests itself in positivism,� he said. �This line of thought had
a great influence on my efforts, most specifically Mach and even more so
Hume,  whose  Treatise  of  Human  Nature  I  studied  avidly  and  with
admiration shortly before discovering the theory of relativity.�81

Hume applied his skeptical rigor to the concept of time. It made no sense,
he  said,  to  speak  of  time  as  having  an  absolute  existence  that  was
independent of observable objects whose movements permitted us to define
time.�From  the  succession  of  ideas  and  impressions  we  form  the  idea  of
time,�  Hume  wrote.  �It  is  not  possible  for  time  alone  ever  to  make  its
appearance.�  This  idea  that  there  is  no  such  thing  as  absolute  time  would
later echo in Einstein�s theory of relativity. Hume�s specific thoughts about
time, however, had less influence on Einstein than his more general insight
that  it  is  dangerous  to  talk  about  concepts  that  are  not  definable  by
perceptions and observations.82

Einstein�s  views  on  Hume  were  tempered  by  his  appreciation  for
Immanuel  Kant  (1724�1804),  the  German  metaphysician  he  had  been
introduced to, back when he was a schoolboy, by Max Talmud. �Kant took
the stage with an idea that signified a step towards the solution of Hume�s
dilemma,�  Einstein  said.  Some  truths  fit  into  a  category  of  �definitely
assured knowledge� that was �grounded in reason itself.�

In  other  words,  Kant  distinguished  between  two  types  of  truths:  (1)
analytic  propositions,  which  derive  from  logic  and  �reason  itself  �  rather
than  from  observing  the  world;  for  example,  all  bachelors  are  unmarried,
two plus two equals four, and the angles of a triangle always add up to 180
degrees; and (2) synthetic propositions, which are based on experience and
observations; for example, Munich is bigger than Bern, all swans are white.
Synthetic propositions could be revised by new empirical evidence, but not
analytic ones. We may discover a black swan but not a married bachelor or
(at least so Kant thought) a triangle with 181 degrees. As Einstein said of
Kant�s first category of truths: �This is held to be the case, for example, in
the  propositions  of  geometry  and  in  the  principle  of  causality.  These  and
certain  other types  of knowledge .  .  .  do not  previously  have to  be gained
from sense data, in other words they are a priori knowledge.�

Einstein  initially  found  it  wondrous  that  certain  truths  could  be
discovered  by  reason  alone.  But  he  soon  began  to  question  Kant�s  rigid
distinction between analytic and synthetic truths.  �The objects  with  which
geometry deals seemed to be of no different type than the objects of sensory
perception,�  he  recalled.  And  later  he  would  reject  outright  this  Kantian
distinction. �I am convinced that this differentiation is erroneous,� he wrote.
A proposition that seems purely analytic�such as the angles of a triangle
adding  up  to  180  degrees�could  turn  out  to  be  false  in  a  non-Euclidean
geometry  or  in  a  curved  space  (such  as  would  be  the  case  in  the  general
theory  of  relativity).  As  he  later  said  of  the  concepts  of  geometry  and
causality,  �Today  everyone  knows,  of  course,  that  the  mentioned  concepts
contain nothing of the certainty, of the inherent necessity, which Kant had
attributed to them.�83

Hume�s  empiricism  was  carried  a  step  further  by  Ernst  Mach  (1838�
1916), the Austrian physicist and philosopher whose writings Einstein read
at  the  urging  of  Michele  Besso.  He  became  one  of  the  favorite  authors  of
the  Olympia  Academy,  and  he  helped  to  instill  in  Einstein  the  skepticism
about  received  wisdom  and  accepted  conventions  that  would  become  a

hallmark  of  his  creativity.  Einstein  would  later  proclaim,  in  words  that
could  be  used  to  describe  himself  as  well,  that  Mach�s  genius  was  partly
due to his �incorruptible skepticism and independence.�84

The  essence  of  Mach�s  philosophy  was  this,  in  Einstein�s  words:
�Concepts have meaning only if we can point to objects to which they refer
and  to  the  rules  by  which  they  are  assigned  to  these  objects.�85  In  other
words, for a concept to make sense you need an operational definition of it,
one  that  describes  how  you  would  observe  the  concept  in  operation.  This
would bear fruit for Einstein when, a few years later, he and Besso would
talk  about  what  observation  would  give  meaning  to  the  apparently  simple
concept that two events happened �simultaneously.�

The  most  influential  thing  that  Mach  did  for  Einstein  was  to  apply  this
approach to Newton�s concepts of �absolute time� and �absolute space.� It
was  impossible  to  define  these  concepts,  Mach  asserted,  in  terms  of
observations  you  could  make.  Therefore  they  were  meaningless.  Mach
ridiculed Newton�s �conceptual monstrosity of absolute space�; he called it
�purely a thought-thing which cannot be pointed to in experience.�86

The final intellectual hero of the Olympia Academy was Baruch Spinoza
(1632�1677),  the  Jewish  philosopher  from  Amsterdam.  His  influence  was
primarily  religious:  Einstein  embraced  his  concept  of  an  amorphous  God
reflected in the awe-inspiring beauty, rationality, and unity of nature�s laws.
But like Spinoza, Einstein did not believe in a personal God who rewarded
and punished and intervened in our daily lives.

In addition, Einstein drew from Spinoza a faith in determinism: a sense
that  the  laws  of  nature,  once  we  could  fathom  them,  decreed  immutable
causes and effects, and that God did not play dice by allowing any events to
be random or undetermined. �All things are determined by the necessity of
divine  nature,�  Spinoza  declared,  and  even  when  quantum  mechanics
seemed to show that was wrong, Einstein steadfastly believed it was right.87

Marrying Mileva

Hermann Einstein was not destined to see his son become anything more
successful  than  a  third-class  patent  examiner.  In  October  1902,  when
Hermann�s  health  began  to  decline,  Einstein  traveled  to  Milan  to  be  with

 
him  at  the  end.  Their  relationship  had  long  been  a  mix  of  alienation  and
affection,  and  it  concluded  on  that  note  as  well.  �When  the  end  came,�
Einstein�s assistant Helen Dukas later said, �Hermann asked all of them to
leave the room, so he could die on his own.�

Einstein felt, for the rest of his life, a sense of guilt about that moment,
which encapsulated his inability to forge a true bond with his father. For the
first  time,  he  was  thrown  into  a  daze,  �overwhelmed  by  a  feeling  of
desolation.� He later called his father�s death the deepest shock he had ever
experienced.  The  event  did,  however,  solve  one  important  issue.  On  his
deathbed,  Hermann  Einstein  gave  his  permission,  finally,  for  his  son  to
marry Mileva Mari .88

Einstein�s  Olympia  Academy  colleagues,  Maurice  Solovine  and  Conrad
Habicht,  convened  in  special  session  on  January  6,  1903,  to  serve  as
witnesses  at  the  tiny  civil  ceremony  in  the  Bern  registrar�s  office  where
Albert Einstein married Mileva Mari . No family members�not Einstein�s
mother  or  sister,  nor  Mari �s  parents�came  to  Bern.  The  tight  group  of
intellectual  comrades  celebrated  together  at  a  restaurant  that  evening,  and
then  Einstein  and  Mari   went  back  to  his  apartment  together.  Not
surprisingly, he had forgotten his key and had to wake his landlady.89

�Well, now I am a married man and I am living a very pleasant cozy life
with  my  wife,�  he  reported  to  Michele  Besso  two  weeks  later.  �She  takes
excellent  care  of  everything,  cooks  well,  and  is  always  cheerful.�  For  her
part,  Mari *  reported  to  her  own  best  friend,  �I  am  even  closer  to  my
sweetheart,  if  it  is  at  all  possible,  than  I  was  in  our  Zurich  days.�
Occasionally  she  would  attend  sessions  of  the  Olympia  Academy,  but
mainly  as  an  observer.  �Mileva,  intelligent  and  reserved,  listened  intently
but never intervened in our discussions,� Solovine recalled.

Nevertheless,  clouds  began  to  form.  �My  new  duties  are  taking  their
toll,�  Mari   said  of  her  housekeeping  chores  and  role  as  a  mere  onlooker
when science was discussed. Einstein�s friends felt that she was becoming
even  more  gloomy.  At  times  she  seemed  laconic,  and  distrustful  as  well.
And Einstein, at least so he claimed in retrospect, had already become wary.
He  had  felt  an  �inner  resistance�  to  marrying  Mari ,  he  later  claimed,  but
had overcome it out of a �sense of duty.�

Mari   soon  began  to  look  for  ways  to  restore  the  magic  to  their
relationship. She hoped that they would escape the bourgeois drudgery that
seemed inherent in the household of a Swiss civil servant and, instead, find

some  opportunity  to  recapture  their  old  bohemian  academic  life.  They
decided�or  at  least  so  Mari   hoped�that  Einstein  would  find  a  teaching
job somewhere far away, perhaps near their forsaken daughter. �We will try
anywhere,� she wrote to her friend in Serbia. �Do you think, for example,
that in Belgrade people of our kind could find something?� Mari  said they
would do anything academic, even teaching German in a high school. �You
see, we still have that old enterprising spirit.�90

As far as we know, Einstein never went to Serbia to seek a job or to see
his  baby.  A  few  months  into  their  marriage,  in  August  1903,  the  secret
cloud  hovering  over  their  lives  suddenly  cast  a  new  pall.  Mari   received
word  that  Lieserl,  then  19  months  old,  had  come  down  with  scarlet  fever.
She boarded a train for Novi Sad. When it stopped in Salzburg, she bought
a  postcard  of  a  local  castle  and  jotted  a  note,  which  she  mailed  from  the
stop in Budapest: �It is going quickly, but it is hard. I don�t feel at all well.
What  are  you  doing,  little  Jonzile,  write  me  soon,  will  you?  Your  poor
Dollie.�91

Apparently, the child was given up for adoption. The only clue we have
is a cryptic letter Einstein wrote Mari  in September, after she had been in
Novi Sad for a month: �I am very sorry about what happened with Lieserl.
Scarlet  fever  often  leaves  some  lasting  trace  behind.  If  only  everything
passes  well.  How  is  Lieserl  registered?  We  must  take  great  care,  lest
difficulties arise for the child in the future.�92

Whatever the motivation Einstein may have had for asking the question,
neither  Lieserl�s  registration  documents  nor  any  other  paper  trace  of  her
existence  is  known  to  have  survived.  Various  researchers,  Serbian  and
American, including Robert Schulmann of the Einstein Papers Project and
Michele  Zackheim,  who  wrote  a  book  about  searching  for  Lieserl,  have
fruitlessly scoured churches, registries, synagogues, and cemeteries.

All  evidence  about  Einstein�s  daughter  was  carefully  erased.  Almost
every one of the letters between Einstein and Mari  in the summer and fall
of  1902,  many  of  which  presumably  dealt  with  Lieserl,  were  destroyed.
Those between Mari  and her friend Helene Savi   during  that period  were
intentionally burned by Savi �s family. For the rest of their lives, even after
they  divorced,  Einstein  and  his  wife  did  all  they  could,  with  surprising
success,  to  cover  up  not  only  the  fate  of  their  first  child  but  her  very
existence.

One of the few facts that have escaped this black hole of history is that
Lieserl was still alive in September 1903. Einstein�s expression of worry, in
his  letter to  Mari   that  month,  about  potential  difficulties  �for  the  child  in
the  future,�  makes  this  clear.  The  letter  also  indicates  that  she  had  been
given  up  for  adoption  by  then,  because  in  it  Einstein  spoke  of  the
desirability of having a �replacement� child.

There are two plausible explanations about the fate of Lieserl. The first is
that  she  survived  her  bout  of  scarlet  fever  and  was  raised  by  an  adoptive
family.  On  a  couple  of  occasions  later  in  his  life,  when  women  came
forward  claiming  (falsely,  it  turned  out)  to  be  illegitimate  children  of  his,
Einstein  did  not  dismiss  the  possibility  out  of  hand,  although  given  the
number of affairs he had, this is no indication that he thought they might be
Lieserl.

One possibility, favored by Schulmann, is that Mari �s friend Helene Savi
  adopted  Lieserl.  She  did  in  fact  raise  a  daughter  Zorka,  who  was  blind
from early childhood (perhaps a result of scarlet fever), was never married,
and was shielded by her nephew from people who sought to interview her.
Zorka died in the 1990s.

The nephew who protected Zorka, Milan Popovi , rejects this possibility.
In  a  book  he  wrote  on  the  friendship  and  correspondence  between  Mari
and his grandmother Helene Savi , In Albert�s Shadow, Popovi  asserted, �A
theory  has  been  advanced  that  my  grandmother  adopted  Lieserl,  but  an
examination  of  my  family�s  history  renders  this  groundless.�  He  did  not,
however,  produce  any  documentary  evidence,  such  as  his  aunt�s  birth
certificate,  to  back  up  this  contention.  His  mother  burned  most  of  Helene
Savi �s  letters,  including  any  that  had  dealt  with  Lieserl.  Popovi �s  own
theory, based partly on the family stories recalled by a Serbian writer named
Mira Ale kovi , is that Lieserl died of scarlet fever in September 1903, after
Einstein�s  letter  of  that  month.  Michele  Zackheim,  in  her  book  describing
her hunt for Lieserl, comes to a similar conclusion.93

Whatever happened added to Mari �s gloom. Shortly after Einstein died,
a writer named Peter Michelmore, who knew nothing of Lieserl, published
a  book  that  was  based  in  part  on  conversations  with  Einstein�s  son  Hans
Albert Einstein. Referring to the year right after their marriage, Michelmore
noted,  �Something  had  happened  between  the  two,  but  Mileva  would  say
only that it was �intensely personal.� Whatever it was, she brooded about it,
and  Albert  seemed  to  be  in  some  ways  responsible.  Friends  encouraged

Mileva to talk about her problem and get it out in the open. She insisted that
it was too personal and kept it a secret all her life�a vital detail in the story
of Albert Einstein that still remains shrouded in mystery.�94

The illness that Mari   complained  about  in  her  postcard  from  Budapest
was likely because she was pregnant again. When she found out that indeed
she  was,  she  worried  that  this  would  anger  her  husband.  But  Einstein
expressed  happiness  on  hearing  the  news  that  there  would  soon  be  a
replacement for their daughter. �I�m not the least bit angry that poor Dollie
is  hatching  a  new  chick,�  he  wrote.  �In  fact,  I�m  happy  about  it  and  had
already given some thought to whether I shouldn�t see to it that you get a
new Lieserl. After all, you shouldn�t be denied that which is the right of all
women.�95

Hans  Albert  Einstein  was  born  on  May  14,  1904.  The  new  child  lifted
Mari �s spirits and restored some joy to her marriage, or so at least she told
her friend Helene Savi : �Hop over to Bern so I can see you again and I can
show you my dear little sweetheart, who is also named Albert. I cannot tell
you how much joy he gives me when he laughs so cheerfully on waking up
or when he kicks his legs while taking a bath.�

Einstein was �behaving with fatherly dignity,� Mari  noted, and he spent
time making little toys for his baby son, such as a cable car he constructed
from matchboxes and string. �That was one of the nicest toys I had at the
time  and  it  worked,�  Hans  Albert  could  still  recall  when  he  was  an  adult.
�Out  of  little  string  and  matchboxes  and  so  on,  he  could  make  the  most
beautiful things.�96

Milos Mari  was so overjoyed with the birth of a grandson that he came
to  visit  and  offered  a  sizable  dowry,  reported  in  family  lore  (likely  with
some  exaggeration)  to  be  100,000  Swiss  francs.  But  Einstein  declined  it,
saying  he  had  not  married  his  daughter  for  money,  Milos  Mari   later
recounted with tears in his eyes. In fact, Einstein was beginning to do well
enough on his own. After more than a year at the patent office, he had been
taken off probationary status.97

THE MIRACLE YEAR: Quanta and

in  1900.  �All 

that  remains 

The  foundations  of  classical  physics  had  been  laid  by  Isaac  Newton
(1642�1727) in the late seventeenth century. Building on the discoveries of
Galileo and others, he developed laws that described a very comprehensible

 
 
 
 
mechanical  universe:  a  falling  apple  and  an  orbiting  moon  were  governed
by  the  same  rules  of  gravity,  mass,  force,  and  motion.  Causes  produced
effects,  forces  acted  upon  objects,  and  in  theory  everything  could  be
explained, determined, and predicted. As the mathematician and astronomer
Laplace exulted about Newton�s universe, �An intelligence knowing all the
forces acting in nature at a given instant, as well as the momentary positions
of  all  things  in  the  universe,  would  be  able  to  comprehend  in  one  single
formula the motions of the largest bodies as well as the lightest atoms in the
world;  to  him  nothing  would  be  uncertain,  the  future  as  well  as  the  past
would be present to his eyes.�2

Einstein  admired  this  strict  causality,  calling  it  �the  profoundest
characteristic of Newton�s teaching.�3 He wryly summarized the history of
physics: �In the beginning (if there was such a thing) God created Newton�s
laws  of  motion  together  with  the  necessary  masses  and  forces.�  What
especially impressed Einstein were �the achievements of mechanics in areas
that  apparently  had  nothing  to  do  with  mechanics,�  such  as  the  kinetic
theory  he  had  been  exploring,  which  explained  the  behavior  of  gases  as
being caused by the actions of billions of molecules bumping around.4

In  the  mid-1800s,  Newtonian  mechanics  was  joined  by  another  great
advance.  The  English  experimenter  Michael  Faraday  (1791�  1867),  the
self-taught son of a blacksmith, discovered the properties of electrical and
magnetic  fields.  He  showed  that  an  electric  current  produced  magnetism,
and  then  he  showed  that  a  changing  magnetic  field  could  produce  an
electric current. When a magnet is moved near a wire loop, or vice versa, an
electric current is produced.5

entrepreneurs  like  Einstein�s  father  and  uncle  to  create  new  ways  of
combining  spinning  wire  coils  and  moving  magnets  to  build  electricity
generators. As a result, young Albert Einstein had a profound physical feel
for Faraday�s fields and not just a theoretical understanding of them.

induction  permitted 

The bushy-bearded Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831�1879)
subsequently  devised  wonderful  equations  that  specified,  among  other
things,  how  changing  electric  fields  create  magnetic  fields  and  how
changing  magnetic  fields  create  electrical  ones.  A  changing  electric  field
could,  in  fact,  produce  a  changing  magnetic  field  that  could,  in  turn,
produce a changing electric field, and so on. The result of this coupling was
an electromagnetic wave.

Just as Newton had been born the year that Galileo died, so Einstein was
born  the  year  that  Maxwell  died,  and  he  saw  it  as  part  of  his  mission  to
extend  the  work  of  the  Scotsman.  Here  was  a  theorist  who  had  shed
prevailing  biases,  let  mathematical  melodies  lead  him  into  unknown
territories,  and  found  a  harmony  that  was  based  on  the  beauty  and
simplicity of a field theory.

All of his life, Einstein was fascinated by field theories, and he described

the development of the concept in a textbook he wrote with a colleague:

A new concept appeared in physics, the most important invention since
Newton�s  time:  the  field.  It  needed  great  scientific  imagination  to
realize  that  it  is  not  the  charges  nor  the  particles  but  the  field  in  the
space  between  the  charges  and  the  particles  that  is  essential  for  the
description  of  physical  phenomena.  The  field  concept  proved
successful  when  it  led  to  the  formulation  of  Maxwell�s  equations
describing the structure of the electromagnetic field.6

At first, the electromagnetic field theory developed by Maxwell seemed
compatible with the mechanics of Newton. For example, Maxwell believed
that electromagnetic waves, which include visible light, could be explained
by  classical  mechanics�if  we  assume  that  the  universe  is  suffused  with
some  unseen,  gossamer  �light-bearing  ether�  that  serves  as  the  physical
substance  that  undulates  and  oscillates  to  propagate  the  electromagnetic
waves, comparable to the role water plays for ocean waves and air plays for
sound waves.

By  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century,  however,  fissures  had  begun  to
develop  in  the  foundations  of  classical  physics.  One  problem  was  that
scientists, as hard as they tried, could not find any evidence of our motion
through this supposed light-propagating ether. The study of radiation�how
light  and  other  electromagnetic  waves  emanate  from  physical  bodies�
exposed another problem: strange things were  happening  at  the  borderline
where  Newtonian  theories,  which  described  the  mechanics  of  discrete
particles,  interacted  with  field  theory,  which  described  all  electromagnetic
phenomena.

Up  until  then,  Einstein  had  published  five  little-noted  papers.  They  had
earned  him  neither  a  doctorate  nor  a  teaching  job,  even  at  a  high  school.
Had he given up theoretical physics at that point, the scientific community

 
would not have noticed, and he might have moved up the ladder to become
the  head  of  the  Swiss  Patent  Office,  a  job  in  which  he  would  likely  have
been very good indeed.

There  was  no  sign  that  he  was  about  to  unleash  an  annus mirabilis  the
like of which science had not seen since 1666, when Isaac Newton, holed
up at his mother�s home in rural Woolsthorpe to escape the plague that was
devastating  Cambridge,  developed  calculus,  an  analysis  of  the  light
spectrum, and the laws of gravity.

But physics was poised to be upended again, and Einstein was poised to
be the one to do it. He had the brashness needed to scrub away the layers of
conventional  wisdom  that  were  obscuring  the  cracks  in  the  foundation  of
physics, and his visual imagination allowed him to make conceptual leaps
that eluded more traditional thinkers.

The  breakthroughs  that  he  wrought  during  a  four-month  frenzy  from
March to June 1905 were heralded in what would become one of the most
famous personal letters in the history of science. Conrad Habicht, his fellow
philosophical frolicker in the Olympia Academy, had just moved away from
Bern,  which,  happily  for  historians,  gave  a  reason  for  Einstein  to  write  to
him in late May.

Dear Habicht,

Such a solemn air of silence has descended between us that I almost
feel as if I am committing a sacrilege when I break it now with some
inconsequential babble . . .

So,  what  are  you  up  to,  you  frozen  whale,  you  smoked,  dried,
canned  piece  of  soul  ...?  Why  have  you  still  not  sent  me  your
dissertation?  Don�t  you  know  that  I  am  one  of  the  1�  fellows  who
would read it with interest and pleasure, you wretched man? I promise
you four papers in return. The first deals with radiation and the energy
properties of light and is very revolutionary, as you will see if you send
me  your  work  first.  The  second  paper  is  a  determination  of  the  true
sizes  of  atoms  ...  The  third  proves  that  bodies  on  the  order  of
magnitude 1/1000 mm, suspended in liquids, must already perform an
observable  random  motion  that  is  produced  by  thermal  motion.  Such
movement  of  suspended  bodies  has  actually  been  observed  by
physiologists who call it Brownian molecular motion. The fourth paper

is only a rough draft at this point, and is an electrodynamics of moving
bodies which employs a modification of the theory of space and time.7

Light Quanta, March 1905

As Einstein noted to Habicht, it was the first of these 1905 papers, not the
famous  final  one  expounding  a  theory  of  relativity,  that  deserved  the
designation �revolutionary.� Indeed, it may contain the most revolutionary
development  in  the  history  of  physics.  Its  suggestion  that  light  comes  not
just  in  waves  but  in  tiny  packets�quanta  of  light  that  were  later  dubbed
�photons��spirits  us  into  strange  scientific  mists  that  are  far  murkier,
indeed  more  spooky,  than  even  the  weirdest  aspects  of  the  theory  of
relativity.

Einstein  recognized  this  in  the  slightly  odd  title  he  gave  to  the  paper,
which he submitted on March 17, 1905, to the Annalen der Physik:  �On  a
Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of
Light.�8  Heuristic?  It  means  a  hypothesis  that  serves  as  a  guide  and  gives
direction in solving a problem but is not considered proven. From this first
sentence  he  ever  published  about  quantum  theory  until  his  last  such
sentence,  which  came  in  a  paper  exactly  fifty  years  later,  just  before  he
died,  Einstein  regarded  the  concept  of  the  quanta  and  all  of  its  unsettling
implications  as  heuristic  at  best:  provisional  and  incomplete  and  not  fully
compatible with his own intimations of underlying reality.

At  the  heart  of  Einstein�s  paper  were  questions  that  were  bedeviling
physics at the turn of the century, and in fact have done so from the time of
the ancient Greeks until today: Is the universe made up of particles, such as
atoms and electrons? Or is it an unbroken continuum, as a gravitational or
electromagnetic field seems to be? And if both methods of describing things
are valid at times, what happens when they intersect?

Since  the  1860s,  scientists  had  been  exploring  just  such  a  point  of
intersection  by  analyzing  what  was  called  �blackbody  radiation.�  As
anyone who has played with a kiln or a gas burner knows, the glow from a
material such as iron changes color as it heats up. First it appears to radiate
mainly red light; as it gets hotter, it glows more orange, and then white and
then  blue.  To  study  this  radiation,  Gustav  Kirchhoff  and  others  devised  a

 
 
closed metal container with a tiny hole to let a little light escape. Then they
drew a graph of the intensity of each wavelength when the device reached
equilibrium at a certain temperature. No matter what the material or shape
of the container�s walls, the results were the same; the shape of the graphs
depended only on the temperature.

There was, alas, a problem. No one could fully account for the basis of
the  mathematical  formula  that  would  produce  the  hill-like  shape  of  these
graphs.

When  Kirchhoff  died,  his  professorship  at  the  University  of  Berlin  was
given to Max Planck. Born in 1858 into an ancient German family of great
scholars,  theologians,  and  lawyers,  Planck  was  many  things  that  Einstein
was  not:  with  his  pince-nez  glasses  and  meticulous  dress,  he  was  very
proudly  German,  somewhat  shy,  steely  in  his  resolve,  conservative  by
instinct,  and  formal  in  his  manner.  �It  is  difficult  to  imagine  two  men  of
more different attitudes,� their mutual friend Max Born later said. �Einstein
a  citizen  of  the  whole  world,  little  attached  to  the  people  around  him,
independent of the emotional background of the society in which he lived�
Planck  deeply  rooted  in  the  traditions  of  his  family  and  nation,  an  ardent
patriot, proud of the greatness of German history and consciously Prussian
in his attitude to the state.�9

His conservatism made Planck skeptical about the atom, and of particle
(rather than wave and continuous field) theories in general. As he wrote in
1882, �Despite the great success that the atomic theory has so far enjoyed,
ultimately  it  will  have  to  be  abandoned  in  favor  of  the  assumption  of
continuous matter.� In one of our planet�s little ironies, Planck and Einstein
would share the fate of laying the groundwork for quantum mechanics, and
then  both  would  flinch  when  it  became  clear  that  it  undermined  the
concepts of strict causality and certainty they both worshipped.10

In 1900, Planck came up with an equation, partly using what he called �a
fortuitous guess,� that described the curve of radiation wavelengths at each
temperature. In doing so he accepted that Boltzmann�s statistical methods,
which  he  had  resisted,  were  correct  after  all.  But  the  equation  had  an  odd
feature:  it  required  the  use  of  a  constant,  which  was  an  unexplained  tiny
quantity (approximately 6.62607 x 10�34  joule-seconds), that needed to  be
included for it to come out right. It was soon dubbed Planck�s constant, h,
and is now known as one of the fundamental constants of nature.

At  first  Planck  had  no  idea  what,  if  any,  physical  meaning  this
mathematical  constant  had.  But  then  he  came  up  with  a  theory  that,  he
thought,  applied  not  to  the  nature  of  light  itself  but  to  the  action  that
occurred when the light was absorbed or emitted by a piece of matter. He
posited that the surface of anything that was radiating heat and light�such
as  the  walls  in  a  blackbody  device�contained  �vibrating  molecules�  or
�harmonic  oscillators,�  like  little  vibrating  springs.11  These  harmonic
oscillators could absorb or emit energy only in the form of discrete packets
or bundles. These packets or bundles of energy came only in fixed amounts,
determined  by  Planck�s  constant,  rather  than  being  divisible  or  having  a
continuous range of values.

Planck  considered  his  constant  a  mere  calculational  contrivance  that
explained the process of emitting or absorbing light but did not apply to the
fundamental nature of light itself. Nevertheless, the declaration he made to
the  Berlin  Physical  Society  in  December  1900  was  momentous:  �We
therefore  regard�and  this  is  the  most  essential  point  of  the  entire
calculation�energy  to  be  composed  of  a  very  definite  number  of  equal
finite packages.�12

Einstein quickly realized that quantum theory could undermine classical
physics.  �All  of  this  was  quite  clear  to  me  shortly  after  the  appearance  of
Planck�s  fundamental  work,�  he  wrote  later.  �All  of  my  attempts  to  adapt
the theoretical foundation of physics to this knowledge failed completely. It
was  as  if  the  ground  had  been  pulled  out  from  under  us,  with  no  firm
foundation to be seen anywhere.�13

In  addition  to  the  problem  of  explaining  what  Planck�s  constant  was
really  all about,  there was  another curiosity about  radiation that needed to
be explained. It was called the photoelectric effect, and it occurs when light
shining  on  a  metal  surface  causes  electrons  to  be  knocked  loose  and
emitted.  In  the  letter  he  wrote  to  Mari   right  after  he  learned  of  her
pregnancy  in  May  1901,  Einstein  enthused  over  a  �beautiful  piece�  by
Philipp Lenard that explored this topic.

Lenard�s  experiments  found  something  unexpected.  When  he  increased
the frequency  of  the  light�moving  from  infrared  heat  and  red  light  up  in
frequency  to  violet  and  ultraviolet�the  emitted  electrons  sped  out  with
much more energy. Then, he increased the intensity of the light by using a
carbon  arc  light  that  could  be  made  brighter  by  a  factor  of  1,000.  The
brighter, more intense light had a lot more energy, so it seemed logical that

the  electrons  emitted  would have more energy and speed away  faster. But
that  did  not  occur.  More  intense  light  produced  more  electrons,  but  the
energy of each remained the same. This was something that the wave theory
of light did not explain.

Einstein  had  been  pondering  the  work  of  Planck  and  Lenard  for  four
years.  In  his  final  paper  of  1904,  �On  the  General  Molecular  Theory  of
Heat,�  he  discussed  how  the  average  energy  of  a  system  of  molecules
fluctuates. He then applied this to a volume filled with radiation, and found
that  experimental  results  were  comparable.  His  concluding  phrase  was,  �I
believe that this agreement must not be ascribed to chance.�14 As he wrote
to  his  friend  Conrad  Habicht  just  after  finishing  that  1904  paper,  �I  have
now found in a most simple way the relation between the size of elementary
quanta of matter and the wavelengths of radiation.� He was thus primed, so
it seems, to form a theory that the radiation field was made up of quanta.15

In his 1905 light quanta paper, published a year later, he did just that. He
took  the  mathematical  quirk  that  Planck  had  discovered,  interpreted  it
literally, related it to Lenard�s photoelectric results, and analyzed light as if
it really was made up of pointlike particles�light quanta, he called them�
rather than being a continuous wave.

Einstein  began  his  paper  by  describing  the  great  distinction  between
theories based on particles (such as the kinetic theory of gases) and theories
that involve continuous functions (such as the electromagnetic fields of the
wave theory of light). �There exists a profound formal difference between
the  theories  that  physicists  have  formed  about  gases  and  other  ponderable
bodies,  and  Maxwell�s  theory  of  electromagnetic  processes  in  so-called
empty  space,�  he  noted.  �While  we  consider  the  state  of  a  body  to  be
completely  determined  by  the  positions  and  velocities  of  a  very  large,  yet
finite,  number  of  atoms  and  electrons,  we  make  use  of  continuous  spatial
functions to describe the electromagnetic state of a given volume.�16

Before he made his case for a particle theory of light, he emphasized that
this  would  not  make  it  necessary  to  scrap  the  wave  theory,  which  would
continue  to  be  useful  as  well.  �The  wave  theory  of  light,  which  operates
with continuous spatial functions, has worked well in the representation of
purely optical phenomena  and will probably  never  be replaced by another
theory.�

His way of accommodating both a wave theory and a particle theory was
to  suggest,  in  a  �heuristic�  way,  that  our  observation  of  waves  involve

statistical averages of the positions of what could be countless particles. �It
should be kept in mind,� he said, �that the optical observations refer to time
averages rather than instantaneous values.�

Then  came  what  may  be  the  most  revolutionary  sentence  that  Einstein
ever wrote. It suggests that light is made up of discrete particles or packets
of energy: �According to the assumption to be considered here, when a light
ray  is  propagated  from  a  point,  the  energy  is  not  continuously  distributed
over  an  increasing  space  but  consists  of  a  finite  number  of  energy  quanta
which  are  localized  at  points  in  space  and  which  can  be  produced  and
absorbed only as complete units.�

Einstein  explored  this  hypothesis  by  determining  whether  a  volume  of
blackbody  radiation,  which  he  was  now  assuming  consisted  of  discrete
quanta, might in fact behave like a volume of gas, which he knew consisted
of discrete  particles.  First,  he looked  at  the  formulas  that showed  how the
entropy of a gas changes when its volume changes. Then he compared this
to how the entropy of blackbody radiation changes as its volume changes.
He found that the entropy of the radiation �varies with volume according to
the same law as the entropy of an ideal gas.�

He  did  a  calculation  using  Boltzmann�s  statistical  formulas  for  entropy.
The  statistical  mechanics  that  described  a  dilute  gas  of  particles  was
mathematically the same as that for blackbody radiation. This led Einstein
to declare that the radiation �behaves thermodynamically as if it consisted
of mutually independent energy quanta.� It also provided a way to calculate
the energy of a �particle� of light at a particular frequency, which turned out
to be in accord with what Planck had found.17

Einstein went on to show how the existence of these light quanta could
explain  what  he  graciously  called  Lenard�s  �pioneering  work�  on  the
photoelectric effect. If light came in discrete quanta, then the energy of each
one  was  determined  simply  by  the  frequency  of  the  light  multiplied  by
Planck�s constant. If we assume, Einstein suggested, �that a light quantum
transfers its entire energy to a single electron,� then it follows that light of a
higher  frequency  would  cause  the  electrons  to  emit  with  more  energy.  On
the other hand, increasing the intensity of the light (but not the frequency)
would simply mean that more electrons would be emitted, but the energy of
each would be the same.

That  was  precisely  what  Lenard  had  found.  With  a  trace  of  humility  or
tentativeness,  along  with  a  desire  to  show  that  his  conclusions  had  been

deduced  theoretically  rather  than  induced  entirely  from  experimental  data,
Einstein  declared  of  his  paper�s  premise  that  light  consists  of  tiny  quanta:
�As far as I can see, our conception does not conflict with the properties of
the photoelectric effect observed by Mr. Lenard.�

By  blowing  on  Planck�s  embers,  Einstein  had  turned  them  into  a  flame
that would consume classical physics. What precisely did Einstein produce
that made his 1905 paper a discontinuous�one is tempted to say quantum
�leap beyond the work of Planck?

In effect, as Einstein noted in a paper the following year, his role was that
he  figured  out  the  physical  significance  of  what  Planck  had  discovered.18
For  Planck,  a  reluctant  revolutionary,  the  quantum  was  a  mathematical
contrivance  that  explained  how  energy  was  emitted  and  absorbed  when  it
interacted with matter. But he did not see that it related to a physical reality
that was inherent in the nature of light and the electromagnetic field itself.
�One  can  interpret  Planck�s  1900  paper  to  mean  only  that  the  quantum
hypothesis  is  used  as  a  mathematical  convenience  introduced  in  order  to
calculate a statistical distribution, not as a new physical assumption,� write
science historians Gerald Holton and Steven Brush.19

Einstein, on the other hand, considered the light quantum to be a feature
of reality: a perplexing, pesky, mysterious, and sometimes maddening quirk
in the cosmos. For him, these quanta of energy (which in 1926 were named
photons)20  existed  even  when  light  was  moving  through  a  vacuum.  �We
wish to show that Mr. Planck�s determination of the elementary quanta is to
some extent independent of his theory of blackbody radiation,� he wrote. In
other  words,  Einstein  argued  that  the  particulate  nature  of  light  was  a
property  of  the  light  itself  and  not  just  some  description  of  how  the  light
interacts with matter.21

Even  after  Einstein  published  his  paper,  Planck  did  not  accept  his  leap.
Two years later, Planck warned the young patent clerk that he had gone too
far,  and  that  quanta  described  a  process  that  occurred  during  emission  or
absorption,  rather than  some  real property of radiation in  a vacuum.  �I do
not  seek  the  meaning  of  the  �quantum  of  action�  (light  quantum)  in  the
vacuum but at the site of absorption and emission,� he advised.22

Planck�s  resistance  to  believing  that  the  light  quanta  had  a  physical
reality  persisted.  Eight  years  after  Einstein�s  paper  was  published,  Planck
proposed him for a coveted seat in the Prussian Academy of Sciences. The
letter  he  and  other  supporters  wrote  was  filled  with  praise,  but  Planck

added:  �That  he  might  sometimes  have  overshot  the  target  in  his
speculations, as for example in his light quantum hypothesis, should not be
counted against him too much.�23

Just before he died, Planck reflected on the fact that he had long recoiled
from  the  implications  of  his  discovery.  �My  futile  attempts  to  fit  the
elementary quantum of action somehow into classical theory continued for
a number of years and cost me a great deal of effort,� he wrote. �Many of
my colleagues saw in this something bordering on a tragedy.�

Ironically,  similar  words  would  later  be  used  to  describe  Einstein.  He
became increasingly �aloof and skeptical� about the quantum discoveries he
pioneered, Born said of Einstein. �Many of us regard this as a tragedy.�24

Einstein�s  theory  produced  a  law  of  the  photoelectric  effect  that  was
experimentally  testable:  the  energy  of  emitted  electrons  would  depend  on
the  frequency  of  the  light  according  to  a  simple  mathematical  formula
involving  Planck�s  constant.  The  formula  was  subsequently  shown  to  be
correct. The physicist who did the crucial experiment was Robert Millikan,
who  would  later  head  the  California  Institute  of  Technology  and  try  to
recruit Einstein.

Yet even after he verified Einstein�s photoelectric formulas, Millikan still
rejected  the  theory.  �Despite  the  apparently  complete  success  of  the
Einstein  equation,�  he  declared,  �the  physical  theory  on  which  it  was
designed to be the symbolic expression is found so untenable that Einstein
himself, I believe, no longer holds to it.�25

Millikan  was  wrong  to  say  that  Einstein�s  formulation  of  the  photo-
electric  effect  had  been  abandoned.  In  fact,  it  was  specifically  for
discovering the law of the photoelectric effect that Einstein would win his
only Nobel Prize. With the advent of quantum mechanics in the 1920s, the
reality of the photon became a fundamental part of physics.

However,  on  the  larger  point  Millikan  was  right.  Einstein  would
increasingly find the eerie implications of the quantum�and of the wave-
particle  duality  of light�to  be deeply  unsettling.  In a letter he wrote near
the  end  of  his  life  to  his  dear  friend  Michele  Besso,  after  quantum
mechanics  had  been  accepted  by  almost  every  living  physicist,  Einstein
would lament, �All these fifty years of pondering have not brought me any
closer to answering the question, What are light quanta?�26

Doctoral  Dissertation  on  the  Size  of  Molecules,
April 1905

Einstein had written a paper that would revolutionize science, but he had
not  yet  been  able  to  earn  a  doctorate.  So  he  tried  one  more  time  to  get  a
dissertation accepted.

He realized that he needed a safe topic, not a radical one like quanta or
relativity, so he chose the second paper he was working on, titled �A New
Determination of Molecular Dimensions,� which he completed on April 30
and submitted to the University of Zurich in July.27

Perhaps out of caution and deference to the conservative approach of his
adviser,  Alfred  Kleiner,  he  generally  avoided  the  innovative  statistical
physics featured in his previous papers (and in his Brownian motion paper
completed  eleven  days  later)  and  relied  instead  mainly  on  classical
hydrodynamics.28  Yet  he  was  still  able  to  explore  how  the  behavior  of
countless  tiny  particles  (atoms,  molecules)  are  reflected  in  observable
phenomena,  and  conversely  how  observable  phenomena  can  tell  us  about
the nature of those tiny unseen particles.

Almost a century earlier, the  Italian scientist  Amedeo Avogadro (1776�
1856)  had  developed  the  hypothesis�correct,  as  it  turned  out�that  equal
volumes of any gas, when measured at the same temperature and pressure,
will  have  the  same  number  of  molecules.  That  led  to  a  difficult  quest:
figuring out just how many this was.

The  volume  usually  chosen  is  that  occupied  by  a  mole  of  the  gas  (its
molecular weight in grams), which is 22.4 liters at standard temperature and
pressure.  The  number  of  molecules  under  such  conditions  later  became
known  as  Avogadro�s  number.  Determining  it  precisely  was,  and  still  is,
rather difficult. A current estimate is approximately 6.02214 x 1023. (This is
a big number: that many unpopped popcorn kernels when spread across the
United States would cover the country nine miles deep.)29

Most  previous  measurements  of  molecules  had  been  done  by  studying
gases. But as Einstein noted in the first sentence of his paper, �The physical
phenomena  observed  in  liquids  have  thus  far  not  served  for  the
determination of molecular sizes.� In this dissertation (after a few math and

 
data corrections were later made), Einstein was the first person able to get a
respectable result using liquids.

His  method  involved  making  use  of  data  about  viscosity,  which  is  how
much resistance a liquid offers to an object that tries to move through it. Tar
and  molasses,  for  example,  are  highly  viscous.  If  you  dissolve  sugar  in
water,  the  solution�s  viscosity  increases  as  it  gets  more  syrupy.  Einstein
envisioned  the  sugar  molecules  gradually  diffusing  their  way  through  the
smaller water molecules. He was able to come up with two equations, each
containing the two unknown variables�the size of the sugar molecules and
the number of them in the water�that he was trying to determine. He could
then  solve  for  these  unknown  variables.  Doing  so,  he  got  a  result  for
Avogadro�s number that was 2.1 x 1023.

That, unfortunately, was not very close. When he submitted his paper to
the Annalen der Physik in August, right after it had been accepted by Zurich
University, the editor Paul Drude (who was blissfully unaware of Einstein�s
earlier  desire  to  ridicule  him)  held  up  its  publication  because  he  knew  of
some better data on the properties of sugar solutions. Using this new data,
Einstein came up with a result that was closer to correct: 4.15 x 1023.

A  few  years  later,  a  French  student  tested  the  approach  experimentally
and discovered something amiss. So Einstein asked an assistant in Zurich to
look  at  it  all  over  again.  He  found  a  minor  error,  which  when  corrected
produced a result of 6.56 x 1023, which ended up being quite respectable.30
Einstein  later  said,  perhaps  half-jokingly,  that  when  he  submitted  his
thesis,  Professor  Kleiner  rejected  it  for  being  too  short,  so  he  added  one
more  sentence  and  it  was  promptly  accepted.  There  is  no  documentary
evidence for this.31 Either way, his thesis actually became one of his most
cited and practically useful papers, with applications in such diverse fields
as cement mixing, dairy production, and aerosol products. And even though
it did not help him get an academic job, it did make it possible for him to
become known, finally, as Dr. Einstein.

Brownian Motion, May 1905

Eleven  days  after  finishing  his  dissertation,  Einstein  produced  another
paper  exploring  evidence  of  things  unseen.  As  he  had  been  doing  since

 
1901,  he  relied  on  statistical  analysis  of  the  random  actions  of  invisible
particles to show how they were reflected in the visible world.

In  doing  so,  Einstein  explained  a  phenomenon,  known  as  Brownian
motion, that had been puzzling scientists for almost eighty years: why small
particles suspended in a liquid such as water are observed to jiggle around.
And as a byproduct, he pretty much settled once and for all that atoms and
molecules actually existed as physical objects.

Brownian  motion  was  named  after  the  Scottish  botanist  Robert  Brown,
who  in  1828  had  published  detailed  observations  about  how  minuscule
pollen particles suspended in water can be seen to wiggle and wander when
examined  under a strong microscope.  The study  was  replicated  with  other
particles,  including  filings  from  the  Sphinx,  and  a  variety  of  explanations
was offered. Perhaps it had something to do with tiny water currents or the
effect of light. But none of these theories proved plausible.

With the rise in the 1870s of the kinetic theory, which used the random
motions  of  molecules  to  explain  things  like  the  behavior  of  gases,  some
tried  to  use  it  to  explain  Brownian  motion.  But  because  the  suspended
particles were 10,000 times larger than a water molecule, it seemed that a
molecule would not have the power to budge the particle any more than a
baseball could budge an object that was a half-mile in diameter.32

Einstein  showed  that  even  though  one  collision  could  not  budge  a
particle, the effect of millions of random collisions per second could explain
the  jig  observed  by  Brown.  �In  this  paper,�  he  announced  in  his  first
sentence, �it will be shown that, according to the molecular-kinetic theory
of heat, bodies of a microscopically visible size suspended in liquids must,
as  a  result  of  thermal  molecular  motions,  perform  motions  of  such
magnitudes that they can be easily observed with a microscope.�33

He  went  on  to  say  something  that  seems,  on  the  surface,  somewhat
puzzling:  his  paper  was  not  an  attempt  to  explain  the  observations  of
Brownian  motion.  Indeed,  he  acted  as  if  he  wasn�t  even  sure  that  the
motions  he  deduced  from  his  theory  were  the  same  as  those  observed  by
Brown:  �It  is  possible  that  the  motions  to  be  discussed  here  are  identical
with  so-called  Brownian molecular  motion;  however,  the  data  available to
me  on  the  latter  are  so  imprecise  that  I  could  not  form  a  judgment  on  the
question.� Later, he distanced his work even further from intending to be an
explanation of Brownian motion: �I discovered that, according to atomistic
theory,  there  would  have  to  be  a  movement  of  suspended  microscopic

particles  open 
concerning the Brownian motion were already long familiar.�34

to  observations,  without  knowing 

that  observations

At  first  glance  his  demurral  that  he  was  dealing  with  Brownian  motion
seems odd, even disingenuous. After all, he had written Conrad Habicht a
few months earlier, �Such movement of suspended bodies has actually been
observed  by  physiologists  who  call  it  Brownian  molecular  motion.�  Yet
Einstein�s  point  was  both  true  and  significant:  his  paper  did  not  start  with
the observed facts of Brownian motion and build toward an explanation of
it. Rather, it was a continuation of his earlier statistical analysis of how the
actions of molecules could be manifest in the visible world.

In other words, Einstein wanted to assert that he had produced a theory
that  was  deduced  from  grand  principles  and  postulates,  not  a  theory  that
was constructed by examining physical data (just as he had made plain that
his  light  quanta  paper  had  not  started  with  the  photo-electric  effect  data
gathered by Philipp Lenard). It was a distinction he would also make, as we
shall  soon  see,  when  insisting  that  his  theory  of  relativity  did  not  derive
merely from trying to explain experimental results about the speed of light
and the ether.

Einstein  realized  that  a  bump  from  a  single  water  molecule  would  not
cause a suspended pollen particle to move enough to be visible. However, at
any given moment, the particle was being hit from all sides by thousands of
molecules.  There  would  be  some  moments  when  a  lot  more  bumps
happened to hit one particular side of the particle. Then, in another moment,
a different side might get the heaviest barrage.

The  result  would  be  random  little  lurches  that  would  result  in  what  is
known as a random walk. The best way for us to envision this is to imagine
a drunk who starts at a lamppost and lurches one step in a random direction
every second. After two such lurches he may have gone back and forth to
return to the lamp. Or he may be two steps away in the same direction. Or
he  may  be  one  step  west  and  one  step  northeast.  A  little  mathematical
plotting and charting reveals an interesting thing about such a random walk:
statistically, the drunk�s distance from the lamp will be proportional to the
square root of the number of seconds that have elapsed.35

Einstein  realized  that  it  was  neither  possible  nor  necessary  to  measure
each zig and zag of Brownian motion, nor to measure the particle�s velocity
at  any  moment.  But  it  was  rather  easy  to  measure  the  total  distances  of
randomly lurching particles as these distances grew over time.

Einstein wanted concrete predictions that could be tested, so he used both
his  theoretical  knowledge  and  experimental  data  about  viscosity  and
diffusion rates to come up with precise predictions showing the distance a
particle  should  move  depending  on  its  size  and  the  temperature  of  the
liquid. For example, he predicted, in the case of a particle with a diameter
of  one  thousandth  of  a  millimeter  in  water  at  17  degrees  centigrade,  �the
mean displacement in one minute would be about 6 microns.�

Here  was  something  that  could  actually  be  tested,  and  with  great
consequence.  �If  the  motion  discussed  here  can  be  observed,�  he  wrote,
�then classical thermodynamics can no longer be viewed as strictly valid.�
Better  at  theorizing  than  at  conducting  experiments,  Einstein  ended  his
paper with a charming exhortation: �Let us hope that a researcher will soon
succeed in solving the problem presented here, which is so important for the
theory of heat.�

Within months, a German experimenter named Henry Seidentopf, using a
powerful  microscope,  confirmed  Einstein�s  predictions.  For  all  practical
purposes, the physical reality of atoms and molecules was now conclusively
proven.  �At  the  time  atoms  and  molecules  were  still  far  from  being
regarded as real,� the theoretical physicist Max Born later recalled. �I think
that these investigations of Einstein have done more than any other work to
convince physicists of the reality of atoms and molecules.�36

As  lagniappe,  Einstein�s  paper  also  provided  yet  another  way  to
determine  Avogadro�s number.  �It  bristles  with  new  ideas,� Abraham  Pais
said  of  the  paper.  �The  final  conclusion,  that  Avogadro�s  number  can
essentially  be  determined  from  observations  with  an  ordinary  microscope,
never  fails  to  cause  a  moment  of  astonishment  even  if  one  has  read  the
paper before and therefore knows the punch line.�

A strength of Einstein�s mind was that it could juggle a variety of ideas
simultaneously. Even as he was pondering dancing particles in a liquid, he
had been wrestling with a different theory that involved moving bodies and
the speed of light. A day or so after sending in his Brownian motion paper,
he was talking to his friend Michele Besso when a new brainstorm struck. It
would produce, as he wrote Habicht in his famous letter of that month, �a
modification of the theory of space and time.�

CHAPTER SIX
SPECIAL RELATIVITY 1905

The Bern Clock Tower

The Background

Relativity  is  a  simple  concept.  It  asserts  that  the  fundamental  laws  of

physics are the same whatever your state of motion.

For  the  special  case  of  observers  moving  at  a  constant  velocity,  this
concept is pretty easy to accept. Imagine a man in an armchair at home and
a woman in an airplane gliding very smoothly above. Each can pour a cup
of coffee, bounce a ball, shine a flashlight, or heat a muffin in a microwave
and have the same laws of physics apply.

In  fact,  there  is  no  way  to  determine  which  of  them  is  �in  motion�  and
which is �at rest.� The man in the armchair could consider himself at rest

 
 
 
 
and the plane in motion. And the woman in the plane could consider herself
at rest and the earth as gliding past. There is no experiment that can prove
who is right.

Indeed,  there  is  no  absolute  right.  All  that  can  be  said  is  that  each  is
moving relative to the other. And of course, both are moving very rapidly
relative to other planets, stars, and galaxies.*

The  special  theory  of  relativity  that  Einstein  developed  in  1905  applies
only  to  this  special  case  (hence  the  name):  a  situation  in  which  the
observers  are  moving  at  a  constant  velocity  relative  to  one  another�
uniformly  in  a  straight  line  at  a  steady  speed�referred  to  as  an  �inertial
reference system.�1

It�s  harder  to  make  the  more  general  case  that  a  person  who  is
accelerating or turning or rotating or slamming on the brakes or moving in
an arbitrary manner is not in some form of absolute motion, because coffee
sloshes  and  balls  roll  away  in  a  different  manner  than  for  people  on  a
smoothly  gliding  train,  plane,  or  planet.  It  would  take  Einstein  a  decade
more, as we shall see, to come up with what he called a general theory of
relativity,  which  incorporated  accelerated  motion  into  a  theory  of  gravity
and attempted to apply the concept of relativity to it.2

the 

that 

laws  of  motion  and  mechanics  (the 

The story of relativity best begins in 1632, when Galileo articulated the
laws  of
principle 
electromagnetism  had  not  yet  been  discovered)  were  the  same  in  all
constant-velocity  reference  frames.  In  his  Dialogue  Concerning  the  Two
Chief World  Systems,  Galileo  wanted  to  defend  Copernicus�s  idea  that  the
earth does not rest motionless at the center of the universe with everything
else revolving around it. Skeptics contended that if the earth was moving, as
Copernicus  said,  we�d  feel  it.  Galileo  refuted  this  with  a  brilliantly  clear
thought experiment about being inside the cabin of a smoothly sailing ship:

Shut  yourself  up  with  some  friend  in  the  main  cabin  below  decks  on
some  large  ship,  and  have  with  you  there  some  flies,  butterflies,  and
other small flying animals. Have a large bowl of water with some fish
in  it;  hang  up  a  bottle  that  empties  drop  by  drop  into  a  wide  vessel
beneath it. With the ship standing still, observe carefully how the little
animals  fly  with  equal  speed  to  all  sides  of  the  cabin.  The  fish  swim
indifferently  in  all  directions;  the  drops  fall  into  the  vessel  beneath;
and, in throwing something to your friend, you need throw it no more

strongly  in  one  direction  than  another,  the  distances  being  equal;
jumping  with  your  feet  together,  you  pass  equal  spaces  in  every
direction. When you have observed all these things carefully, have the
ship proceed with any speed you like, so long as the motion is uniform
and  not  fluctuating  this  way  and  that.  You  will  discover  not  the  least
change in  all the  effects named,  nor could  you  tell  from any of them
whether the ship was moving or standing still.3

There is no better description of relativity, or at least of how that principle
applies  to  systems  that  are  moving  at  a  constant  velocity  relative  to  each
other.

Inside  Galileo�s  ship,  it  is  easy  to  have  a  conversation,  because  the  air
that carries the sound waves is moving smoothly along with the people in
the chamber. Likewise, if one of Galileo�s passengers dropped a pebble into
a bowl of water, the ripples would emanate the same way they would if the
bowl were resting on shore; that�s because the water propagating the ripples
is  moving  smoothly  along  with  the  bowl  and  everything  else  in  the
chamber.

Sound  waves  and  water  waves  are  easily  explained  by  classical
mechanics. They are simply a traveling disturbance in some medium. That
is  why  sound  cannot  travel  through  a  vacuum.  But  it  can  travel  through
such  things  as  air  or  water  or  metal.  For  example,  sound  waves  move
through  room  temperature  air,  as  a  vibrating  disturbance  that  compresses
and rarefies the air, at about 770 miles per hour.

Deep inside Galileo�s ship, sound and water waves behave as they do on
land, because the air in the chamber and the water in the bowls are moving
at the same velocity as the passengers. But now imagine that you go up on
deck and look at the waves out in the ocean, or that you measure the speed
of the sound waves from the horn of another boat. The speed at which these
waves  come  toward  you  depends  on  your  motion  relative  to  the  medium
(the water or air) propagating them.

In  other  words,  the  speed  at  which  an  ocean  wave  reaches  you  will
depend on how fast you are moving through the water toward or away from
the  source  of  the  wave.  The  speed  of  a  sound  wave  relative  to  you  will
likewise  depend  on  your  motion  relative  to  the  air  that�s  propagating  the
sound wave.

 
Those relative speeds add up. Imagine that you are standing in the ocean
as the waves come toward you at 10 miles per hour. If you jump on a Jet
Ski and head directly into the waves at 40 miles per hour, you will see them
moving toward you and zipping past you at a speed (relative to you) of 50
miles per hour. Likewise, imagine that sound waves are coming at you from
a distant boat horn, rippling through still air at 770 miles per hour toward
the shore. If you jump on your Jet Ski and head toward the horn at 40 miles
per hour, the sound waves will be moving toward you and zipping past you
at a speed (relative to you) of 810 miles per hour.

All of this led to a question that Einstein had been pondering since age
16, when he imagined riding alongside a light beam: Does light behave the
same way?

Newton had conceived of light as primarily a stream of emitted particles.
But by Einstein�s day, most scientists accepted the rival theory, propounded
by  Newton�s  contemporary  Christiaan  Huygens,  that  light  should  be
considered a wave.

A wide variety of experiments had confirmed the wave theory by the late
nineteenth century. For example, Thomas Young did a famous experiment,
now replicated by high school students, showing how light passing through
two slits produces an interference pattern that resembles that of water waves
going  through  two  slits.  In  each  case,  the  crests  and  troughs  of  the  waves
emanating  from  each  slit  reinforce  each  other  in  some  places  and  cancel
each other out in some places.

James  Clerk  Maxwell  helped  to  enshrine  this  wave  theory  when  he
successfully  conjectured  a  connection  between  light,  electricity,  and
magnetism.  He  came  up  with  equations  that  described  the  behavior  of
electric and magnetic fields, and when they were combined they predicted
electromagnetic  waves.  Maxwell  found  that  these  electromagnetic  waves
had to travel at a certain speed: approximately 186,000 miles per second.*
That was the speed that scientists had already measured for light, and it was
obviously not a mere coincidence.4

It  became  clear  that  light  was  the  visible  manifestation  of  a  whole
spectrum  of  electromagnetic  waves.  This  includes  what  we  now  call  AM
radio signals (with a wavelength of 300 yards), FM radio signals (3 yards),
and  microwaves  (3  inches).  As  the  wavelengths  get  shorter  (and  the
frequency of the wave cycles thus increases), they produce the spectrum of
visible  light,  ranging  from  red  (25  millionths  of  an  inch)  to  violet  (14

millionths  of  an  inch).  Even  shorter  wavelengths  produce  ultraviolet  rays,
X-rays,  and  gamma  rays.  When  we  speak  of  �light�  and  the  �speed  of
light,� we mean all electromagnetic waves, not just the ones that are visible
to our eyes.

That  raised  some  big  questions:  What  was  the  medium  that  was
propagating these waves? And their speed of 186,000 miles per second was
a speed relative to what?

The  answer,  it  seemed,  was  that  light  waves  are  a  disturbance  of  an
unseen medium, which was called the ether, and that their speed is relative
to this ether. In other words, the ether was for light waves something akin to
what air was for sound waves. �It appeared beyond question that light must
be interpreted  as a vibratory  process  in  an elastic, inert  medium  filling  up
universal space,� Einstein later noted.5

This  ether,  unfortunately,  needed  to  have  many  puzzling  properties.
Because light from distant stars is able to reach the earth, the ether had to
pervade the entire known universe. It had to be so gossamer and, shall we
say, so ethereal that it had no effect on planets and feathers floating through
it. Yet it had to be stiff enough to allow a wave to vibrate through it at an
enormous speed.

All  of  this  led  to  the  great  ether  hunt  of  the  late  nineteenth  century.  If
light was indeed a wave rippling through the ether, then you should see the
waves going by you at a faster speed if you were moving through the ether
toward the light source. Scientists devised all sorts of ingenious devices and
experiments to detect such differences.

They used a variety of suppositions of how the ether might behave. They
looked for it as if it were motionless and the earth passed freely through it.
They looked for it as if the earth dragged parts of it along in a blob, the way
it  does  its  own  atmosphere.  They  even  considered  the  unlikely  possibility
that the  earth was  the  only  thing at  rest with  respect to  the  ether,  and that
everything  else  in  the  cosmos  was  spinning  around,  including  the  other
planets, the sun, the stars, and presumably poor Copernicus in his grave.

One experiment, which Einstein later called �of fundamental importance
in the special theory of relativity,�6 was by the French physicist Hippolyte
Fizeau, who sought to measure the speed of light in a moving medium. He
split a light beam with a half-silvered angled mirror that sent one part of the
beam through water in the direction of the water�s flow and the other part
against the flow. The two parts of the beam were then reunited. If one route

took longer, then the crests and troughs of its waves would be out of sync
with  the  waves  of  the  other  beam.  The  experimenters  could  tell  if  this
happened  by  looking  at  the  interference  pattern  that  resulted  when  the
waves were rejoined.

A  different  and  far  more  famous  experiment  was  done  in  Cleveland  in
1887  by  Albert  Michelson  and  Edward  Morley.  They  built  a  contraption
that similarly split a light beam and sent one part back and forth to a mirror
at the end of an arm facing in the direction of the earth�s movement and the
other  part  back  and  forth  along  an  arm  at  a  90-degree  angle  to  it.  Once
again,  the  two  parts  of  the  beam  were  then  rejoined  and  the  interference
pattern analyzed to see if the path that was going up against the supposed
ether wind would take longer.

No  matter  who  looked,  or  how  they  looked,  or  what  suppositions  they
made about the behavior of the ether, no one was able to detect the elusive
substance.  No  matter  which  way  anything  was  moving,  the  speed  of  light
was observed to be exactly the same.

So  scientists,  somewhat  awkwardly,  turned  their  attention  to  coming  up
with explanations about why the ether existed but was undetectable in any
experiment.  Most  notably,  in  the  early  1890s  Hendrik  Lorentz�the
cosmopolitan  and  congenial  Dutch  father  figure  of  theoretical  physics�
and, independently, the Irish physicist George Fitzgerald came up with the
hypothesis that solid objects contracted slightly when they moved through
the  ether.  The  Lorentz-Fitzgerald  contraction  would  shorten  everything,
including the measuring arms used by Michelson and Morley, and it would
do  so  by  just  the  exact  amount  to  make  the  effect  of  the  ether  on  light
undetectable.

Einstein  felt  that  the  situation  �was  very  depressing.�  Scientists  found
themselves  unable  to  explain  electromagnetism  using  the  Newtonian
�mechanical  view  of  nature,�  he  said,  and  this  �led  to  a  fundamental
dualism which in the long run was insupportable.�7

Einstein�s Road to Relativity

�A new idea comes suddenly and in a rather intuitive way,� Einstein once
said.  �But,�  he  hastened  to  add,  �intuition  is  nothing  but  the  outcome  of
earlier intellectual experience.�8

 
Einstein�s discovery of special relativity involved an intuition based on a
decade of intellectual as well as personal experiences.9 The most important
and  obvious,  I  think,  was  his  deep  understanding  and  knowledge  of
theoretical  physics.  He  was  also  helped  by  his  ability  to  visualize  thought
experiments, which had been encouraged by his education in Aarau. Also,
there  was  his  grounding  in  philosophy:  from  Hume  and  Mach  he  had
developed  a  skepticism  about  things  that  could  not  be  observed.  And  this
skepticism  was  enhanced  by  his  innate  rebellious  tendency  to  question
authority.

Also  part  of  the  mix�and  probably  reinforcing  his  ability  to  both
visualize  physical  situations  and  to  cut  to  the  heart  of  concepts�was  the
technological  backdrop  of  his  life:  helping  his  uncle  Jakob  to  refine  the
moving  coils  and  magnets  in  a  generator;  working  in  a  patent  office  that
was  being  flooded  with  applications  for  new  methods  of  coordinating
clocks; having a boss who encouraged him to apply his skepticism; living
near the clock tower and train station and just above the telegraph office in
Bern  just  as  Europe  was  using  electrical  signals  to  synchronize  clocks
within  time  zones;  and  having  as  a  sounding  board  his  engineer  friend
Michele  Besso,  who  worked  with  him  at  the  patent  office,  examining
electromechanical devices.10

The  ranking  of  these  influences  is,  of  course,  a  subjective  judgment.
After all, even Einstein himself could not be sure how the process unfolded.
�It  is  not  easy  to  talk  about  how  I  arrived  at  the  theory  of  relativity,�  he
said. �There were so many hidden complexities to motivate my thought.�11
One thing we can note with some confidence is Einstein�s main starting
point. He repeatedly said that his path toward the theory of relativity began
with his thought experiment at age 16 about what it would be like to ride at
the  speed  of  light  alongside  a  light  beam.  This  produced  a  �paradox,�  he
said, and it troubled him for the next ten years:

If  I  pursue  a  beam  of  light  with  the  velocity  c  (velocity  of  light  in  a
vacuum), I should observe such a beam of light as an electromagnetic
field  at  rest  though  spatially  oscillating.  There  seems  to  be  no  such
thing,  however,  neither  on  the  basis  of  experience  nor  according  to
Maxwell�s  equations.  From  the  very  beginning  it  appeared  to  me
intuitively clear that, judged from the standpoint of such an observer,
everything would have to happen according to the same laws as for an

observer who, relative to the earth, was at rest. For how should the first
observer  know  or  be  able  to  determine  that  he  is  in  a  state  of  fast
uniform  motion?  One  sees  in  this  paradox  the  germ  of  the  special
relativity theory is already contained.12

This  thought experiment  did  not  necessarily undermine  the  ether theory
of light waves. An ether theorist could imagine a frozen light beam. But it
violated Einstein�s intuition that the laws of optics should obey the principle
of relativity. In other words, Maxwell�s equations, which specify the speed
of  light,  should  be  the  same  for  all  observers  in  constant-velocity  motion.
The emphasis that Einstein placed on this memory indicates that the idea of
frozen  electromagnetic  waves�seemed
a 
instinctively wrong to him.13

light  beam�or 

frozen 

In  addition,  the  thought  experiment  suggests  that  he  sensed  a  conflict
between  Newton�s  laws  of  mechanics  and  the  constancy  of  the  speed  of
light in Maxwell�s equations. All of this instilled in him �a state of psychic
tension� that he found deeply unnerving. �At the very beginning, when the
special  theory  of  relativity  began  to  germinate  in  me,  I  was  visited  by  all
sorts  of  nervous  conflicts,�  he  later  recalled.  �When  young,  I  used  to  go
away for weeks in a state of confusion.�14

There  was  also  a  more  specific  �asymmetry�  that  began  to  bother  him.
When  a  magnet  moves  relative  to  a  wire  loop,  an  electric  current  is
produced.  As  Einstein  knew  from  his  experience  with  his  family�s
generators, the amount of this electric current is exactly the same whether
the magnet is moving while the coil seems to be sitting still, or the coil is
moving  while  the  magnet  seems  to  be  sitting  still.  He  also  had  studied  an
1894  book  by  August  F�ppl,  Introduction  to  Maxwell�s  Theory  of
Electricity. It had a section specifically on �The Electrodynamics of Moving
Conductors� that questioned whether, when induction occurs, there should
be  any  distinction  between  whether  the  magnet  or  the  conducting  coil  is
said to be in motion.15

�But  according  to  the  Maxwell-Lorentz  theory,�  Einstein  recalled,  �the
theoretical  interpretation  of  the  phenomenon  is  very  different  for  the  two
cases.� In the first case, Faraday�s law of induction said that the motion of
the  magnet  through  the  ether  created  an  electric  field.  In  the  second  case,
Lorentz�s  force  law  said  a  current  was  created  by  the  motion  of  the

 
conducting coil through the magnetic field. �The idea that these two cases
should essentially be different was unbearable to me,� Einstein said.16

Einstein had been wrestling for years with the concept of the ether, which
theoretically  determined  the  definition  of  �at  rest�  in  these  electrical
induction theories. As a student at the Zurich Polytechnic in 1899, he had
written  to  Mileva  Mari   that  �the  introduction  of  the  term  �ether�  into
theories of electricity has led to the conception of a medium whose motion
can be described without, I believe, being able to ascribe physical meaning
to  it.�17 Yet  that very month he was  on vacation  in  Aarau  working with  a
teacher at his old school on ways to detect the ether. �I had a good idea for
investigating the way in which a body�s relative motion with respect to the
ether affects the velocity of the propagation of light,� he told Mari .

Professor  Weber  told  Einstein  that  his  approach  was  impractical.
Probably  at  Weber�s  suggestion,  Einstein  then  read  a  paper  by  Wilhelm
Wien that described the null results of thirteen ether-detection experiments,
including those by Michelson and Morley and by Fizeau.18 He also learned
about the Michelson-Morley experiment by reading, sometime before 1905,
Lorentz�s  1895  book,  Attempt  at  a  Theory  of  Electrical  and  Optical
Phenomena in Moving Bodies. In this book, Lorentz goes through  various
failed attempts to detect the ether as a prelude to developing his theory of
contractions.19

�Induction and Deduction in Physics�

So  what  effect  did  the  Michelson-Morley  results�which  showed  no
evidence  of  the  ether  and  no  difference  in  the  observed  speed  of  light  no
matter in what direction the observer was moving�have on Einstein as he
was incubating his ideas on relativity? To hear him tell it, almost none at all.
In fact, at times he would even recollect (incorrectly) that he had not even
known  of  the  experiment  before  1905.  Einstein�s  inconsistent  statements
over the next fifty years about the influence of Michelson-Morley are useful
in that they remind us of the caution needed when writing history based on
dimming recollections.20

Einstein�s  trail  of  contradictory  statements  begins  with  an  address  he
gave  in  Kyoto,  Japan,  in  1922,  when  he  noted  that  Michelson�s  failure  to

 
detect an ether was �the first path that led me to what we call the principle
of  special  relativity.�  In  a  toast  at  a  1931  dinner  in  Pasadena  honoring
Michelson,  Einstein  was  gracious  to  the  eminent  experimenter,  yet  subtly
circumspect:  �You  uncovered  an  insidious  defect  in  the  ether  theory  of
light, as it then existed, and stimulated the ideas of Lorentz and Fitzgerald,
out of which the Special Theory of Relativity developed.�21

Einstein described his thought process in a series of talks with the Gestalt
psychology  pioneer  Max  Wertheimer,  who  later  called  the  Michelson-
Morley results �crucial� to Einstein�s thinking. But as Arthur I. Miller has
shown,  this  assertion  was  probably  motivated  by  Wertheimer�s  goal  of
using  Einstein�s  tale  as  a  way  to  illustrate  the  tenets  of  Gestalt
psychology.22

Einstein  further  confused  the  issue  in  the  last  few  years  of  his  life  by
giving  a  series  of  statements  on  the  subject  to  a  physicist  named  Robert
Shankland.  At  first  he  said  he  had  read  of  Michelson-Morley  only  after
1905, then he said he had read about it in Lorentz�s book before 1905, and
finally he added, �I guess I just took it for granted that it was true.�23

That  final  point  is  the  most  significant  one  because  Einstein  made  it
often. He simply took for granted, by the time he started working seriously
on relativity, that there was no need to review all the ether-drift experiments
because, based on his starting assumptions, all attempts to detect the ether
were  doomed  to  failure.24  For  him,  the  significance  of  these  experimental
results  was  to  reinforce  what  he  already  believed:  that  Galileo�s  relativity
principle applied to light waves.25

This may account for the scant attention he gave to the experiments in his
1905  paper.  He  never  mentioned  the  Michelson-Morley  experiment  by
name, even where it would have been relevant, nor the Fizeau experiment
using  moving  water.  Instead,  right  after  discussing  the  relativity  of  the
magnet-and-coil  movements,  he  merely  flicked  in  a  phrase  about  �the
unsuccessful  attempts  to  detect  a  motion  of  the  earth  relative  to  the  light
medium.�

Some scientific theories depend primarily on induction: analyzing a lot of
experimental  findings  and  then  finding  theories  that  explain  the  empirical
patterns. Others depend more on deduction: starting with elegant principles
and  postulates  that  are  embraced  as  holy  and  then  deducing  the
consequences from them. All scientists blend both approaches to differing
degrees.  Einstein  had  a  good  feel  for  experimental  findings,  and  he  used

this knowledge to find certain fixed points upon which he could construct a
theory.26 But his emphasis was primarily on the deductive approach.27

Remember  how  in  his  Brownian  motion  paper  he  so  oddly,  yet
accurately, downplayed the  role  that experimental findings  played  in  what
was essentially a theoretical deduction? There was a similar situation with
his  relativity  theory.  What  he  implied  about  Brownian  motion  he  said
explicitly  about  relativity  and  Michelson-Morley:  �I  was  pretty  much
convinced of the validity of the principle before I knew of this experiment
and its results.�

Indeed,  all  three  of  his  epochal  papers  in  1905  begin  by  asserting  his
intention  to  pursue  a  deductive  approach.  He  opens  each  one  by  pointing
out some oddity caused by jostling theories, rather than some unexplained
set  of  experimental  data.  He  then  postulates  grand  principles  while
minimizing the role played by data, be it on Brownian motion or blackbody
radiation or the speed of light.28

In  a  1919  essay  called  �Induction  and  Deduction  in  Physics,�  he

described his preference for the latter approach:

The  simplest  picture  one can form about  the  creation  of an empirical
science is along the lines of an inductive method. Individual facts are
selected  and  grouped  together  so  that  the  laws  that  connect  them
become apparent ... However, the big advances in scientific knowledge
originated  in  this  way  only  to  a  small  degree  .  .  .  The  truly  great
advances  in  our  understanding  of  nature  originated  in  a  way  almost
diametrically  opposed  to  induction.  The  intuitive  grasp  of  the
essentials  of  a  large  complex  of  facts  leads  the  scientist  to  the
postulation  of  a  hypothetical  basic  law  or  laws.  From  these  laws,  he
derives his conclusions.29

His appreciation for this approach would grow. �The deeper we penetrate
and the more extensive our theories become,� he would declare near the end
of  his  life,  �the  less  empirical  knowledge  is  needed  to  determine  those
theories.�30

By  the  beginning  of  1905,  Einstein  had  begun  to  emphasize  deduction
rather than induction in his attempt to explain electrodynamics. �By and by,
I  despaired  of  the  possibility  of  discovering  the  true  laws  by  means  of
constructive  efforts  based  on  experimentally  known  facts,�  he  later  said.

 
�The  longer  and  the  more  despairingly  I  tried,  the  more  I  came  to  the
conviction that only the discovery of a universal formal principle could lead
us to assured results.�31

The Two Postulates

Now that Einstein had decided to pursue his theory from the top down,
by  deriving  it  from  grand  postulates,  he  had  a  choice  to  make:  What
postulates�what  basic  assumptions  of  general  principle�would  he  start
with?32

His first postulate was the principle of relativity, which asserted that all
of  the  fundamental  laws  of  physics,  even  Maxwell�s  equations  governing
electromagnetic  waves,  are  the  same  for  all  observers  moving  at  constant
velocity relative to each other. Put more precisely, they are the same for all
inertial reference systems, the same for someone at rest relative to the earth
as for someone traveling at a uniform velocity on a train or spaceship. He
had  nurtured  his  faith  in  this  postulate  beginning  with  his  thought
experiment about riding alongside a light beam: �From the very beginning
it appeared to me intuitively clear that, judged from the standpoint of such
an observer, everything would have to happen according to the same laws
as for an observer who, relative to the earth, was at rest.�

For a companion postulate, involving the velocity of light, Einstein had at

least two options:

1.  He  could  go  with  an  emission  theory,  in  which  light  would  shoot
from  its  source  like  particles  from  a  gun.  There  would  be  no  need
for  an  ether.  The  light  particles  could  zoom  through  emptiness.
Their speed would be relative to the source. If this source was racing
toward  you,  its  emissions  would  come  at  you  faster  than  if  it  was
racing away. (Imagine a pitcher who can throw a ball at 100 miles
per hour. If he throws it at you from a car racing toward you it will
come at you faster than if he throws it from a car racing away.) In
other words, starlight would be emitted from a star at 186,000 miles
per second; but if that star was heading toward earth at 10,000 miles
per second, the speed of its light would be 196,000 miles per second
relative to an observer on earth.

 
2. An alternative was to postulate that the speed of light was a constant
186,000  miles  per  second  irrespective  of  the  motion  of  the  source
that  emitted  it,  which  was  more  consistent  with  a  wave  theory.  By
analogy  with  sound  waves,  a  fire  truck  siren  does  not  throw  its
sound at you faster when it�s rushing toward you than it does when
it�s standing still. In either case, the sound travels through the air at
770 miles per hour.*

For a while, Einstein explored the emission theory route. This approach
was  particularly  appealing  if  you  conceived  of  light  as  behaving  like  a
stream of quanta. And as noted in the previous chapter, that concept of light
quanta  was  precisely  what  Einstein  had  propounded  in  March  1905,  just
when he was wrestling with his relativity theory.33

But  there  were  problems  with  this  approach.  It  seemed  to  entail
abandoning  Maxwell�s  equations  and  the  wave  theory.  If  the  velocity  of  a
light wave depended on the velocity of the source that emitted it, then the
light  wave  must  somehow  encode  within  it  this  information.  But
experiments and Maxwell�s equations indicated that was not the case.34

Einstein  tried  to  find  ways  to  modify  Maxwell�s  equations  so  that  they
would fit an emission theory, but the quest became frustrating. �This theory
requires  that  everywhere  and  in  each  fixed  direction  light  waves  of  a
different velocity of propagation  should  be possible,�  he later  recalled.  �It
may  be  impossible  to  set  up  a  reasonable  electromagnetic  theory  that
accomplishes such a feat.�35

In  addition,  scientists  had  not  been  able  to  find  any  evidence  that  the
velocity of light depended on that of its source. Light coming from any star
seemed to arrive at the same speed.36

The more Einstein thought about an emission theory, the more problems
he encountered. As he explained to his friend Paul Ehrenfest, it was hard to
figure  out  what  would  happen  when  light  from  a  �moving�  source  was
refracted or reflected by a screen at rest. Also, in an emission theory, light
from an accelerating source might back up on itself.

So Einstein rejected the emission theory in favor of postulating that the
speed  of  a  light  beam  was  constant  no  matter  how  fast  its  source  was
moving.  �I  came  to  the  conviction  that  all  light  should  be  defined  by
frequency  and  intensity  alone,  completely  independently  of  whether  it
comes  from  a  moving  or  from  a  stationary  light  source,�  he  told
Ehrenfest.37

Now  Einstein  had  two  postulates:  �the  principle  of  relativity�  and  this
new  one,  which  he  called  �the  light  postulate.�  He  defined  it  carefully:
�Light always propagates in empty space with a definite velocity V that is
independent  of  the  state  of  motion  of  the  emitting  body.�38For  example,
when  you  measure  the  velocity  of  light  coming  from  the  headlight  of  a
train, it will always be a constant 186,000 miles per second, even if the train
is rushing toward you or backing away from you.

Unfortunately,  this  light  postulate  seemed  to  be  incompatible  with  the
principle  of  relativity.  Why?  Einstein  later  used  the  following  thought
experiment to explain his apparent dilemma.

Imagine that �a ray of light is sent along the embankment� of a railway
track, he said. A man standing on the embankment would measure its speed
as  186,000  miles  per  second  as  it  zipped  past  him.  But  now  imagine  a
woman who is riding in a very fast train carriage that is racing away from
the light source at 2,000 miles per second. We would assume that she would
observe the beam to be zipping past her at only 184,000 miles per second.
�The  velocity  of  propagation  of  a  ray  of  light  relative  to  the  carriage  thus
comes out smaller,� Einstein wrote.

�But  this  result  comes  into  conflict  with  the  principle  of  relativity,�  he
added.  �For,  like  every  other  general  law  of  nature,  the  law  of  the
transmission  of  light  must,  according  to  the  principle  of  relativity,  be  the
same  when  the  railway  carriage  is  the  reference  body  as  it  is  when  the
embankment  is  the  reference  body.�  In  other  words,  Maxwell�s  equations,
which  determine  the  speed  at  which  light  propagates,  should  operate  the
same way in the moving carriage as on the embankment. There should be
no  experiment  you  can  do,  including  measuring  the  speed  of  light,  to
distinguish  which  inertial  frame  of  reference  is  �at  rest�  and  which  is
moving at a constant velocity.39

This was an odd result. A woman racing along the tracks toward or away
from  the  source  of  a  light  beam  should  see  that  beam  zip  by  her  with  the
exact  same  speed  as  an  observer  standing  on  the  embankment  would  see
that same beam zip by him. The woman�s speed relative to the train would
vary, depending on whether she was running toward it or away from it. But
her speed relative to the light beam coming from the train�s headlight would
be  invariant.  All  of  this  made  the  two  postulates,  Einstein  thought,
�seemingly  incompatible.�  As  he  later  explained  in  a  lecture  on  how  he
came to his theory, �the constancy of the velocity of light is not consistent

with the law of the addition of velocities. The result was that I had to spend
almost one year in fruitless thoughts.�40

By combining the light postulate with the principle of relativity, it meant
that an observer would measure the speed of light as the same whether the
source  was  moving toward or away  from him, or whether  he was  moving
toward  or  away  from  the  source,  or  both,  or  neither.  The  speed  of  light
would be the same whatever the motion of the observer and the source.

That  is  where  matters  stood  in  early  May  1905.  Einstein  had  embraced
the relativity principle and elevated it to a postulate. Then, with a bit more
trepidation,  he  had  adopted  as  a  postulate  that  the  velocity  of  light  was
independent of the motion of its source. And he puzzled over the apparent
dilemma  that  an  observer  racing  up  a  track  toward  a  light  would  see  the
beam  coming  at  him  with  the  same  velocity  as  when  he  was  racing  away
from the light�and with the same velocity as someone standing still on the
embankment would observe the same beam.

�In view of this dilemma, there appears to be nothing else to do than to
abandon  either  the  principle  of  relativity  or  the  simple  law  of  the
propagation of light,� Einstein wrote.41

Then something delightful happened. Albert Einstein, while talking with
a  friend,  took  one  of  the  most  elegant  imaginative  leaps  in  the  history  of
physics.

�The Step�

It was a beautiful day in Bern, Einstein later remembered, when he went
to visit his best friend Michele Besso, the brilliant but unfocused engineer
he  had  met  while  studying  in  Zurich  and  then  recruited  to  join  him  at  the
Swiss Patent Office. Many days they would walk to work together, and on
this occasion Einstein told Besso about the dilemma that was dogging him.

�I�m  going  to  give  it  up,�  Einstein  said  at  one  point.  But  as  they
discussed  it,  Einstein  recalled,  �I  suddenly  understood  the  key  to  the
problem.� The next day, when he saw Besso, Einstein was in a state of great
excitement.  He  skipped  any  greeting  and  immediately  declared,  �Thank
you. I�ve completely solved the problem.�42

Only  five  weeks  elapsed  between  that  eureka  moment  and  the  day  that
Einstein  sent  off  his  most  famous  paper,  �On  the  Electrodynamics  of

 
Moving Bodies.� It contained no citations of other literature, no mention of
anyone else�s work, and no acknowledgments except for the charming one
in  the  last  sentence:  �Let  me  note  that  my  friend  and  colleague  M.  Besso
steadfastly stood by me in my work on the problem discussed here, and that
I am indebted to him for several valuable suggestions.�

So  what  was  the  insight  that  struck  him  while  talking  to  Besso?  �An
analysis  of  the  concept  of  time  was  my  solution,�  Einstein  said.  �Time
cannot  be  absolutely  defined,  and  there  is  an  inseparable  relation  between
time and signal velocity.�

More specifically, the key insight was that two events that appear to be
simultaneous to one observer will not appear to be simultaneous to another
observer who is moving rapidly. And there is no way to declare that one of
the  observers  is  really  correct.  In  other  words,  there  is  no  way  to  declare
that the two events are truly simultaneous.

Einstein  later  explained  this  concept  using  a  thought  experiment
involving  moving  trains.  Suppose  lightning  bolts  strike  the  train  track�s
embankment at two distant places, A and B. If we declare that they struck
simultaneously, what does that mean?

Einstein  realized  that  we  need  an  operational  definition,  one  we  can
actually apply, and that would require taking into account the speed of light.
His answer was that we would define the two strikes as simultaneous if we
were  standing  exactly  halfway  between  them  and  the  light  from  each
reached us at the exact same time.

But now let us imagine how the event looks to a train passenger who is
moving  rapidly  along  the  track.  In  a  1916  book  written  to  explain  this  to
nonscientists, he used the following drawing, in which the long train is the
line on the top:

Suppose that at the exact instant (from the viewpoint of the person on the
embankment) when lightning strikes at points A and B, there is a passenger
at  the  midpoint  of  the  train,  Mt,  just  passing  the  observer  who  is  at  the
midpoint alongside the tracks, M. If the train was motionless relative to the

 
embankment,  the  passenger  inside  would  see  the  lightning  flashes
simultaneously, just as the observer on the embankment would.

But  if  the  train  is  moving  to  the  right  relative  to  the  embankment,  the
observer inside will be rushing closer toward place B while the light signals
are traveling. Thus he will be positioned slightly to the right by the time the
light  arrives;  as  a  result,  he  will  see  the  light  from  the  strike  at  place  B
before he will see the light from the strike at place A. So he will assert that
lightning  hit  at  B  before  it  did  so  at  A,  and  the  strikes  were  not
simultaneous.

�We thus arrive at the important result: Events that are simultaneous with
reference  to  the  embankment  are  not  simultaneous  with  respect  to  the
train,� said Einstein. The principle of relativity says that there is no way to
decree that the embankment is �at rest� and the train �in motion.� We can
say only that they are in motion relative to each other. So there is no �real�
or  �right�  answer.  There  is  no  way  to  say  that  any  two  events  are
�absolutely� or �really� simultaneous.43

This is a simple insight, but also a radical one. It means that there is no
absolute time. Instead, all moving reference frames have their own relative
time.  Although  Einstein  refrained  from  saying  that  this  leap  was  as  truly
�revolutionary�  as  the  one  he  made  about  light  quanta,  it  did  in  fact
transform science. �This was a change in the very foundation of physics, an
unexpected and very radical change that required all the courage of a young
and revolutionary genius,� noted Werner Heisenberg, who later contributed
to a similar feat with his principle of quantum uncertainty.44

In  his  1905  paper,  Einstein  used  a  vivid  image,  which  we  can  imagine
him conceiving as he watched the trains moving into the Bern station past
the  rows  of  clocks  that  were  synchronized  with  the  one  atop  the  town�s
famed  tower.  �Our  judgments  in  which  time  plays  a  part  are  always
judgments of simultaneous events,� he wrote. �If, for instance, I say, �That
train arrives here at 7 o�clock,� I mean something like this: �The pointing of
the small hand of my watch to 7 and the arrival of the train are simultaneous
events.� � Once again, however, observers who are moving rapidly relative
to one another will have a different view on whether two distant events are
simultaneous.

The concept of absolute time�meaning a time that exists in �reality� and
tick-tocks  along  independent  of  any  observations  of  it�had  been  a
mainstay  of  physics  ever  since  Newton  had  made  it  a  premise  of  his

Principia  216  years  earlier.  The  same  was  true  for  absolute  space  and
distance.�Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself and from its own
nature,  flows  equably  without  relation  to  anything  external,�  he  famously
wrote  in  Book  1  of  the  Principia.  �Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,
without  relation 
to  anything  external,  remains  always  similar  and
immovable.�

But  even  Newton  seemed  discomforted  by  the  fact  that  these  concepts
could  not  be  directly  observed.  �Absolute  time  is  not  an  object  of
perception,� he admitted. He resorted to relying on the presence of God to
get him out of the dilemma. �The Deity endures forever and is everywhere
present,  and  by  existing  always  and  everywhere,  He  constitutes  duration
and space.�45

Ernst  Mach,  whose  books  had  influenced  Einstein  and  his  fellow
members of the Olympia Academy, lambasted Newton�s notion of absolute
time  as  a  �useless  metaphysical  concept�  that  �cannot  be  produced  in
experience.� Newton, he charged, �acted contrary to his expressed intention
only to investigate actual facts.�46

Henri  Poincar�  also  pointed  out  the  weakness  of  Newton�s  concept  of
absolute  time  in  his  book  Science and  Hypothesis,  another  favorite  of  the
Olympia Academy. �Not only do we have no direct intuition of the equality
of  two  times,  we  do  not  even  have  one  of  the  simultaneity  of  two  events
occurring in different places,� he wrote.47

Both  Mach  and  Poincar�  were,  it  thus  seems,  useful  in  providing  a
foundation  for  Einstein�s  great  breakthrough.  But  he  owed  even  more,  he
later said, to the skepticism he learned from the Scottish philosopher David
Hume  regarding  mental  constructs  that  were  divorced  from  purely  factual
observations.

Given the number of times in his papers that he uses thought experiments
involving moving trains and distant clocks, it is also logical to surmise that
he was helped in visualizing and articulating his thoughts by the trains that
moved past Bern�s clock tower and the rows of synchronized clocks on the
station platform. Indeed, there is a tale that involves him discussing his new
theory with friends by pointing to (or at least referring to) the synchronized
clocks  of  Bern  and  the  unsynchronized  steeple  clock  visible  in  the
neighboring village of Muni.48

Peter  Galison  provides  a  thought-provoking  study  of  the  technological
ethos  in  his  book  Einstein�s  Clocks,  Poincar�s  Maps.  Clock  coordination

was in the air at the time. Bern had inaugurated an urban time network of
electrically  synchronized  clocks  in  1890,  and  a  decade  later,  by  the  time
Einstein  had  arrived,  finding  ways  to  make  them  more  accurate  and
coordinate them with clocks in other cities became a Swiss passion.

In addition, Einstein�s chief duty at the patent office, in partnership with
Besso, was evaluating electromechanical devices. This included a flood of
applications for ways to synchronize clocks by using electric signals. From
1901 to 1904, Galison notes, there were twenty-eight such patents issued in
Bern.

One of them, for example, was called �Installation with Central Clock for
Indicating the Time Simultaneously in Several Places Separated from One
Another.� A similar application arrived on April 25, just three weeks before
Einstein had his breakthrough conversation with Besso; it involved a clock
with an electromagnetically controlled pendulum that could be coordinated
with another such clock through an electric signal. What these applications
had  in  common  was  that  they  used  signals  that  traveled  at  the  speed  of
light.49

We  should  be  careful  not  to  overemphasize  the  role  played  by  the
technological  backdrop  of  the  patent  office.  Although  clocks  are  part  of
Einstein�s  description  of  his  theory,  his  point  is  about  the  difficulties  that
observers in relative motion have in using light signals to synchronize them,
something that was not an issue for the patent applicants.50

Nevertheless,  it  is  interesting  to  note  that  almost  the  entire  first  two
sections of his relativity paper deal directly and in vivid practical detail (in a
manner  so  different  from  the  writings  of,  say,  Lorentz  and  Maxwell)  with
the two real-world technological phenomena he knew best. He writes about
the  generation  of  �electric  currents  of  the  same  magnitude�  due  to  the
�equality of relative motion� of coils and magnets, and the use of �a light
signal� to make sure that �two clocks are synchronous.�

As Einstein himself stated, his time in the patent office �stimulated me to
see  the  physical  ramifications  of  theoretical  concepts.�51  And  Alexander
Moszkowski,  who  compiled  a  book  in  1921  based  on  conversations  with
Einstein,  noted  that  Einstein  believed  there  was  �a  definite  connection
between  the  knowledge  acquired  at  the  patent  office  and  the  theoretical
results.�52

�On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies�

Now let�s look at how Einstein articulated all of this in the famous paper
that  the  Annalen  der  Physik  received  on  June  30,  1905.  For  all  its
momentous import, it may be one of the most spunky and enjoyable papers
in  all  of  science.  Most  of  its  insights  are  conveyed  in  words  and  vivid
thought experiments, rather than in complex equations. There is some math
involved,  but  it  is  mainly  what  a  good  high  school  senior  could
comprehend.  �The  whole  paper  is  a  testament  to  the  power  of  simple
language to convey deep and powerfully disturbing ideas,� says the science
writer Dennis Overbye.53

The  paper  starts  with  the  �asymmetry�  that  a  magnet  and  wire  loop
induce an electric current based only on their relative motion to one another,
but  since  the  days  of  Faraday  there  had  been  two  different  theoretical
explanations  for  the  current  produced  depending  on  whether  it  was  the
magnet or the loop that was in motion.54 �The observable phenomenon here
depends  only  on  the  relative  motion  of  the  conductor  and  the  magnet,�
Einstein  writes,  �whereas  the  customary  view  draws  a  sharp  distinction
between the two cases in which either the one or the other of these bodies is
in motion.�55

The  distinction  between  the  two  cases  was  based  on  the  belief,  which
most scientists still held, that there was such a thing as a state of �rest� with
respect  to  the  ether.  But  the  magnet-and-coil  example,  along  with  every
observation made on light, �suggest that the phenomena of electrodynamics
as well as of mechanics possess no properties corresponding to the idea of
absolute rest.� This prompts Einstein to raise �to the status of a postulate�
the  principle  of  relativity,  which  holds  that  the  laws  of  mechanics  and
electrodynamics  are  the  same  in  all  reference  systems  moving  at  constant
velocity relative to one another.

Einstein goes on to propound the other postulate upon which his theory
was premised: the constancy of the speed of light �independent of the state
of motion of the emitting body.� Then, with the casual stroke of a pen, and
the  marvelously  insouciant  word  �superfluous,�  the  rebellious  patent
examiner  dismissed  two  generations�  worth  of  accrued  scientific  dogma:
�The introduction of a �light ether� will prove to be superfluous, inasmuch
as the view to be developed here will not require a �space at absolute rest.� �

 
Using these two postulates, Einstein explained the great conceptual step
he had taken during his talk with Besso. �Two events which, viewed from a
system  of coordinates,  are  simultaneous,  can no  longer  be looked  upon as
simultaneous  events  when  envisaged  from  a  system  which  is  in  motion
relative to that system.� In other words, there is no such thing as absolute
simultaneity.

In  phrases  so  simple  as  to  be  seductive,  Einstein  pointed  out  that  time
itself can be defined only by referring to simultaneous events, such as the
small hand of a watch pointing to 7 as a train arrives. The obvious yet still
astonishing conclusion: with no such thing as absolute simultaneity, there is
no  such  thing  as  �real�  or  absolute  time.  As  he  later  put  it,  �There  is  no
audible tick-tock everywhere in the world that can be considered as time.�56
Moreover,  this  realization  also  meant  overturning  the  other  assumption
that Newton made at the beginning of his Principia. Einstein showed that if
time  is  relative,  so  too  are  space  and  distance:  �If  the  man  in  the  carriage
covers the distance w in a unit of time�measured from the train�then this
distance�as measured from the embankment�is not necessarily also equal
to w.�57

Einstein  explained  this  by  asking  us  to  picture  a  rod  that  has  a  certain
length  when  it  is  measured  while  it  is  stationary  relative  to  the  observer.
Now imagine that the rod is moving. How long is the rod?

One  way  to  determine  this  is  by  moving  alongside  the  rod,  at  the  same
speed, and superimposing a measuring stick on it. But how long would the
rod be if measured by someone not in motion with it? In that case, a way to
measure  the  moving  rod  would  be  to  determine,  based  on  synchronized
stationary  clocks,  the  precise  location  of  each  end  of  the  rod  at  a  specific
moment,  and  then  use  a  stationary  ruler  to  measure  the  distance  between
these two points. Einstein shows that these methods will produce different
results.

Why?  Because  the  two  stationary  clocks  have  been  synchronized  by  a
stationary observer. But what happens if an observer who is moving as fast
as the  rod tries  to  synchronize those  clocks? She  would  synchronize them
differently,  because  she  would  have  a  different  perception  of  simultaneity.
As Einstein put it, �Observers moving with the moving rod would thus find
that the two clocks were not synchronous, while observers in the stationary
system would declare the clocks to be synchronous.�

Another consequence of special relativity is that a person standing on the
platform will observe that time goes more slowly on a train speeding past.
Imagine that on the train there is a �clock� made up of a mirror on the floor
and  one  on  the  ceiling  and  a  beam  of  light  that  bounces  up  and  down
between them. From the perspective of a woman on the train, the light goes
straight  up  and  then  straight  down.  But  from  the  perspective  of  a  man
standing  on  the  platform,  it  appears  that  the  light  is  starting  at  the  bottom
but  moving  on  a  diagonal  to  get  to  the  ceiling  mirror,  which  has  zipped
ahead a tiny bit, then  bouncing  down on a diagonal  back to  the  mirror on
the floor, which has in turn zipped ahead a tiny bit. For both observers, the
speed of the  light  is  the  same  (that  is  Einstein�s great given).  The man  on
the track observes the distance the light has to travel as being longer than
the woman on the train observes it to be. Thus, from the perspective of the
man on the track, time is going by more slowly inside the speeding train.58

Another way to picture this is to use Galileo�s ship. Imagine a light beam
being shot down from the top of the mast to the deck. To an observer on the
ship, the light beam will travel the exact length of the mast. To an observer
on land, however, the light beam will travel a diagonal formed by the length
of  the  mast  plus  the  distance  (it�s  a  fast  ship)  that  the  ship  has  traveled
forward during the time it took the light to get from the top to the bottom of
the mast. To both observers, the speed of light is the same. To the observer
on  land,  it  traveled  farther  before  it  reached  the  deck.  In  other  words,  the
exact  same  event  (a  light  beam  sent  from  the  top  of  the  mast  hitting  the
deck) took longer when viewed by a person on land than by a person on the
ship.59

This  phenomenon,  called  time  dilation,  leads  to  what  is  known  as  the
twin paradox. If a man stays on the platform while his twin sister takes off
in a spaceship that travels long distances at nearly the speed of light, when
she returns she would be younger than he is. But because motion is relative,
this seems to present a paradox. The sister on the spaceship might think it�s
her  brother  on  earth  who  is  doing  the  fast  traveling,  and  when  they  are
rejoined she would expect to observe that it was he who did not age much.

Could they each come back younger than the other one? Of course not.
The phenomenon does not work in both directions. Because the spaceship
does not travel at a constant velocity, but instead must turn around, it�s the
twin on the spaceship, not the one on earth, who would age more slowly.

The  phenomenon  of  time  dilation  has  been  experimentally  confirmed,
even by using test clocks on commercial planes. But in our normal life, it
has  no  real  impact,  because  our  motion  relative  to  any  other  observer  is
never  anything  near  the  speed  of  light.  In  fact,  if  you  spent  almost  your
entire life on an airplane, you would have aged merely 0.00005 seconds or
so  less  than  your  twin  on  earth  when  you  returned,  an  effect  that  would
likely be counteracted by a lifetime spent eating airline food.60

Special  relativity  has  many  other  curious  manifestations.  Think  again
about that light clock on the train. What happens as the train approaches the
speed of light relative to an observer on the platform? It would take almost
forever for a light beam in the train to bounce from the floor to the moving
ceiling and back to the moving floor. Thus time on the train would almost
stand still from the perspective of an observer on the platform.

As  an  object  approaches  the  speed  of  light,  its  apparent  mass  also
increases.  Newton�s  law  that  force  equals  mass  times  acceleration  still
holds, but as the apparent mass increases, more and more force will produce
less  and  less  acceleration.  There  is  no  way  to  apply  enough  force  to  push
even a pebble faster than the speed of light. That�s the ultimate speed limit
of the  universe, and no particle  or piece  of information can go  faster  than
that, according to Einstein�s theory.

With all this talk of distance and duration being relative depending on the
observer�s  motion,  some  may  be  tempted  to  ask:  So  which  observer  is
�right�?  Whose  watch  shows  the  �actual�  time  elapsed?  Which  length  of
the rod is �real�? Whose notion of simultaneity is �correct�?

According to the special theory of relativity, all inertial reference frames
are equally valid. It is not a question of whether rods actually shrink or time
really  slows  down;  all  we  know  is  that  observers  in  different  states  of
motion  will  measure  things  differently.  And  now  that  we  have  dispensed
with  the  ether  as  �superfluous,�  there  is  no  designated  �rest�  frame  of
reference that has preference over any other.

One of Einstein�s clearest explanations of what he had wrought was in a

letter to his Olympia Academy colleague Solovine:

The theory of relativity can be outlined in a few words. In contrast to
the fact, known since ancient times, that movement is perceivable only
as  relative  movement,  physics  was  based  on  the  notion  of  absolute
movement.  The  study  of  light  waves  had  assumed  that  one  state  of

to  discover 

movement,  that  of  the  light-carrying  ether,  is  distinct  from  all  others.
All  movements  of  bodies  were  supposed  to  be  relative  to  the  light-
carrying  ether,  which  was  the  incarnation  of  absolute  rest.  But  after
this
efforts 
hypothetical  ether  through  experiments  had  failed,  it  seemed  that  the
problem should be restated. That is what the theory of relativity did. It
assumed that there are no privileged physical states of movement and
asked what consequences could be drawn from this.

the  privileged  state  of  movement  of 

Einstein�s  insight,  as  he  explained  it  to  Solovine,  was  that  we  must
discard  concepts  that  �have  no  link  with  experience,�  such  as  �absolute
simultaneity� and �absolute speed.�61

It is very important to note, however, that the theory of relativity does not
mean  that  �everything  is  relative.�  It  does  not  mean  that  everything  is
subjective.

Instead,  it  means  that  measurements  of  time,  including  duration  and
simultaneity, can be relative,  depending  on the  motion  of the  observer. So
can the measurements of space, such as distance and length. But there is a
union of the two, which we call spacetime, and that remains invariant in all
inertial  frames.  Likewise,  there  are  things  such  as  the  speed  of  light  that
remain invariant.

In fact, Einstein briefly considered calling his creation Invariance Theory,
but the name never took hold. Max Planck used the term Relativtheorie in
1906, and by 1907 Einstein, in an exchange with his friend Paul Ehrenfest,
was calling it Relativit�tstheorie.

One way to understand that Einstein was talking about invariance, rather
than  declaring  everything  to  be  relative,  is  to  think  about  how  far  a  light
beam  would  travel  in  a  given  period  of  time.  That  distance  would  be  the
speed of light multiplied by the amount of time it traveled. If we were on a
platform observing this happening on a train speeding by, the elapsed time
would  appear  shorter  (time  seems  to  move  more  slowly  on  the  moving
train), and the distance would appear shorter (rulers seem to be contracted
on the moving train). But there is a relationship between the two quantities
�a  relationship  between  the  measurements  of  space  and  of  time�that
remains invariant, whatever your frame of reference.62

A more complex way to understand this is the method used by Hermann
Minkowski,  Einstein�s  former  math  teacher  at  the  Zurich  Polytechnic.

 
Reflecting  on  Einstein�s  work,  Minkowski  uttered  the  expression  of
amazement  that  every  beleaguered  student  wants  to  elicit  someday  from
condescending  professors.  �It  came  as  a  tremendous  surprise,  for  in  his
student days Einstein had been a lazy dog,� Minkowski told physicist Max
Born. �He never bothered about mathematics at all.�63

Minkowski decided to give a formal mathematical structure to the theory.
His approach was the same one suggested by the time traveler on the first
page  of  H.  G.  Wells�s  great  novel  The  Time  Machine,  published  in  1895:
�There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of
Space, and a fourth, Time.� Minkowski turned all events into mathematical
coordinates  in  four  dimensions,  with  time  as  the  fourth  dimension.  This
permitted  transformations  to  occur,  but  the  mathematical  relationships
between the events remained invariant.

Minkowski dramatically announced his new mathematical approach in a
lecture  in  1908.  �The  views  of  space  and  time  which  I  wish  to  lay  before
you have sprung from the soil of experimental physics, and therein lies their
strength,�  he  said.  �They  are  radical.  Henceforth  space  by  itself,  and  time
by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of
union of the two will preserve an independent reality.�64

Einstein, who was still not yet enamored of math, at one point described
Minkowski�s  work  as  �superfluous  learnedness�  and  joked,  �Since  the
mathematicians  have  grabbed  hold  of  the  theory  of  relativity,  I  myself  no
longer  understand  it.�  But  he  in  fact  came  to  admire  Minkowski�s
handiwork  and  wrote  a  section  about  it  in  his  popular  1916  book  on
relativity.

What  a  wonderful  collaboration  it  could  have  been!  But  at  the  end  of
1908, Minkowski was taken to the hospital, fatally stricken with peritonitis.
Legend has it that he declared, �What a pity that I have to die in the age of
relativity�s development.�65

Once again, it�s worth asking why Einstein discovered a new theory and
his contemporaries did not. Both Lorentz and Poincar� had already come up
with  many  of  the  components  of  Einstein�s  theory.  Poincar�  even
questioned the absolute nature of time.

But neither Lorentz nor Poincar� made the full leap: that there is no need
to posit an ether, that there is no absolute rest, that time is relative based on
an observer�s motion, and so is space. Both men, the physicist Kip Thorne
says, �were groping toward the same revision of our notions of space and

time  as  Einstein,  but  they  were  groping  through  a  fog  of  misperceptions
foisted on them by Newtonian physics.�

Einstein,  by  contrast,  was  able  to  cast  off  Newtonian  misconceptions.
�His  conviction  that  the  universe  loves  simplification  and  beauty,  and  his
willingness to be guided by this conviction, even if it meant destroying the
foundations  of  Newtonian  physics,  led  him,  with  a  clarity  of  thought  that
others could not match, to his new description of space and time.�66

Poincar�  never  made 

the  connection  between 

the  relativity  of
simultaneity  and  the  relativity  of  time,  and  he  �drew  back  when  on  the
brink� of understanding the full ramifications of his ideas about local time.
Why did he hesitate? Despite his interesting insights, he was too much of a
traditionalist  in  physics  to  display  the  rebellious  streak  in-grained  in  the
unknown patent examiner.67 �When he came to the decisive step, his nerve
failed him and he clung to old habits of thought and familiar ideas of space
and time,� Banesh Hoffmann said of Poincar�. �If this seems surprising, it
is because we underestimate the boldness of Einstein in stating the principle
of relativity as an axiom and, by keeping faith with it, changing our notion
of space and time.�68

A  clear  explanation  of  Poincar�s  limitations  and  Einstein�s  boldness
comes  from  one  of  Einstein�s  successors  as  a  theoretical  physicist  at  the
Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, Freeman Dyson:

The  essential  difference  between  Poincar�  and  Einstein  was  that
Poincar�  was  by  temperament  conservative  and  Einstein  was  by
temperament revolutionary. When Poincar� looked for a new theory of
electromagnetism, he tried to preserve as much as he could of the old.
He loved the ether and continued to believe in it, even when his own
theory  showed  that  it  was  unobservable.  His  version  of  relativity
theory was a patchwork quilt. The new idea of local time, depending
on the motion of the observer, was patched onto the old framework of
absolute  space  and  time  defined  by  a  rigid  and  immovable  ether.
Einstein,  on  the  other  hand,  saw  the  old  framework  as  cumbersome
and  unnecessary  and  was  delighted  to  be  rid  of  it.  His  version  of  the
theory was simpler and more elegant. There was no absolute space and
time  and  there  was  no  ether.  All  the  complicated  explanations  of
electric  and  magnetic  forces  as  elastic  stresses  in  the  ether  could  be

swept  into  the  dustbin  of  history,  together  with  the  famous  old
professors who still believed in them.69

As  a  result,  Poincar�  expressed  a  principle  of  relativity  that  contained
certain  similarities  to  Einstein�s,  but  it  had  a  fundamental  difference.
Poincar� retained the existence of the ether, and the speed of light was, for
him, constant only when measured by those at rest to this presumed ether�s
frame of reference.70

Even more surprising, and revealing, is the fact that Lorentz and Poincar�
never  were  able  to  make  Einstein�s  leap  even  after  they  read  his  paper.
Lorentz  still  clung  to  the  existence  of  the  ether  and  its  �at  rest�  frame  of
reference.  In  a  lecture  in  1913,  which  he  reprinted  in  his  1920  book  The
Relativity Principle, Lorentz said, �According to Einstein, it is meaningless
to speak of motion relative to the ether. He likewise denies the existence of
absolute simultaneity. As far as this lecturer is concerned, he finds a certain
satisfaction  in  the  older  interpretations,  according  to  which  the  ether
possesses  at  least  some  substantiality,  space  and  time  can  be  sharply
separated,  and  simultaneity  without  further  specification  can  be  spoken
of.�71

For  his  part,  Poincar�  seems  never  to  have  fully  understood  Einstein�s
breakthrough.  Even  in  1909,  he  was  still  insisting  that  relativity  theory
required  a  third  postulate,  which  was  that  �a  body  in  motion  suffers  a
deformation  in  the  direction  in  which  it  was  displaced.�  In  fact,  the
contraction  of  rods  is  not,  as  Einstein  showed,  some  separate  hypothesis
involving  a  real  deformation,  but  rather  the  consequence  of  accepting
Einstein�s theory of relativity.

Until his death in 1912, Poincar� never fully gave up the concept of the
ether or the notion of absolute rest. Instead, he spoke of the adoption of �the
principle of relativity according to Lorentz.� He never fully understood or
accepted the  basis  of Einstein�s theory. �Poincar� stood  steadfast and held
to his position that in the world of perceptions there was an absoluteness of
simultaneity,� notes the science historian Arthur I. Miller.72

His Partner

 
 
�How happy and proud I will be when the two of us together will have
brought  our  work  on  the  relative  motion  to  a  conclusion!�  Einstein  had
written his lover Mileva Mari  back in 1901.73 Now it had been brought to
that conclusion, and Einstein was so exhausted when he finished a draft in
June that �his body buckled and he went to bed for two weeks,� while Mari
 �checked the article again and again.�74

Then they did something unusual: they celebrated together. As soon as he
finished all four of the papers that he had promised in his memorable letter
to  Conrad  Habicht,  he  sent  his  old  colleague  from  the  Olympia  Academy
another  missive,  this  one  a  postcard  signed  by  his  wife  as  well.  It  read  in
full: �Both of us, alas, dead drunk under the table.�75

All  of  which  raises  a  question  more  subtle  and  contentious  than  that
posed by the influences of Lorentz and Poincar�: What was Mileva Mari �s
role?

That  August,  they  took  a  vacation  together  in  Serbia  to  see  her  friends
and family. While there, Mari  was proud and also willing to accept part of
the credit. �Not long ago we finished a very significant work that will make
my  husband  world  famous,�  she  told  her  father,  according  to  stories  later
recorded there. Their relationship seemed restored, for the time being, and
Einstein  happily  praised  his  wife�s  help.  �I  need  my  wife,�  he  told  her
friends in Serbia.�She solves all the mathematical problems for me.�76

Some  have  contended  that  Mari   was  a  full-fledged  collaborator,  and
there was even a report, later discredited,77 that an early draft version of his
relativity  paper  had  her  name  on  it  as  well.  At  a  1990  conference  in  New
Orleans, the American Association for the Advancement of Science held a
panel on the issue at which Evan Walker, a physicist and cancer researcher
from  Maryland,  debated  John  Stachel,  the  leader  of  the  Einstein  Papers
Project.  Walker  presented  the  various  letters  referring  to  �our  work,�  and
Stachel replied that such phrases were clearly romantic politeness and that
there was �no evidence at all that she contributed any ideas of her own.�

The controversy, understandably, fascinated both scientists and the press.
Columnist Ellen Goodman wrote a wry commentary in the Boston Globe, in
which she judiciously laid out the evidence, and the Economist did a story
headlined �The Relative Importance of Mrs. Einstein.� Another conference
followed in 1994 at the University of Novi Sad, where organizer Professor
Rastko Magli  contended that it was time �to emphasize Mileva�s merit in
order  to  ensure  a  deserved  place  in  the  history  of  science  for  her.�  The

public  discussion  culminated  with  a  PBS  documentary,  Einstein�s Wife, in
2003,  that  was  generally  balanced,  although  it  gave  unwarranted  credence
to the report that her name had been on the original manuscript.78

From  all  the  evidence,  Mari   was  a  sounding  board,  though  not  as
important  in  that  role  as  Besso.  She  also  helped  check  his  math,  although
there  is  no  evidence  that  she  came  up  with  any  of  the  mathematical
concepts.  In  addition,  she  encouraged  him  and  (what  at  times  was  more
difficult) put up with him.

For  both  the  sake  of  colorful  history  and  the  emotional  resonance  it
would  have,  it  would  be  fun  if  we  could  go  even  further  than  this.  But
instead,  we  must  follow  the  less  exciting  course  of  being  confined  to  the
evidence. None of their many letters, to each other or to friends, mentions a
single instance of an idea or creative concept relating to relativity that came
from Mari .

Nor  did  she  ever�even  to  her  family  and  close  friends  while  in  the
throes  of  their  bitter  divorce�claim  to  have  made  any  substantive
contributions  to  Einstein�s  theories.  Her  son  Hans  Albert,  who  remained
devoted to her and lived with her during the divorce, gave his own version
that  was  reflected  in  a  book  by  Peter  Michelmore,  and  it  seems  to  reflect
what  Mari   told  her  son:  �Mileva  helped  him  solve  certain  mathematical
problems,  but  no  one  could  assist  with  the  creative  work,  the  flow  of
ideas.�79

There is, in fact, no need to exaggerate Mari �s contributions in order to
admire,  honor,  and  sympathize  with  her  as  a  pioneer.  To  give  her  credit
beyond  what  she  ever  claimed,  says  the  science  historian  Gerald  Holton,
�only detracts both from her real and significant place in history and from
the tragic unfulfillment of her early hopes and promise.�

Einstein admired the pluck and courage of a feisty female physicist who
had  emerged  from  a  land  where  women  were  generally  not  allowed  to  go
into  that  field.  Nowadays,  when  the  same  issues  still  reverberate  across  a
century  of  time,  the  courage  that  Mari   displayed  by  entering  and
competing in the male-dominated world of physics and math is what should
earn  her  an  admired  spot  in  the  annals  of  scientific  history.  This  she
deserves without inflating the importance of her collaboration on the special
theory of relativity.80

The E=mc2Coda, September 1905

Einstein  had  raised  the  curtain  on  his  miracle  year  in  his  letter  to  his
Olympia Academy mate Conrad Habicht, and he celebrated its climax with
his  one-sentence  drunken  postcard  to  him.  In  September,  he  wrote  yet
another letter to Habicht, this one trying to entice him to come work at the
patent office. Einstein�s reputation as a lone wolf was somewhat artificial.
�Perhaps it would be possible to smuggle you in among the patent slaves,�
he said. �You probably would find it relatively pleasant. Would you actually
be ready and willing to come? Keep in mind that besides the eight hours of
work, each day also has eight hours for fooling around, and then there�s also
Sunday. I would love to have you here.�

As  with  his  letter  six  months  earlier,  Einstein  went  on  to  reveal  quite
casually a momentous scientific breakthrough, one that would be expressed
by the most famous equation in all of science:

One more consequence of the electrodynamics paper has also crossed
my  mind.  Namely,  the  relativity  principle,  together  with  Maxwell�s
equations,  requires  that  mass  be  a  direct  measure  of  the  energy
contained in a body. Light carries mass with it. With the case of radium
there should be a noticeable reduction of mass. The thought is amusing
and seductive; but for all I know, the good Lord might be laughing at
the  whole  matter  and  might  have  been  leading  me  up  the  garden
path.81

Einstein developed the idea with a beautiful simplicity. The paper that the
Annalen der Physik received from him on September  27,  1905, �Does  the
Inertia  of  a  Body  Depend  on  Its  Energy  Content?,�  involved  only  three
steps that filled merely three pages. Referring back to his special relativity
paper, he declared, �The results of an electrodynamic investigation recently
published by me in this journal lead to a very interesting conclusion, which
will be derived here.�82

Once again, he was deducing a theory from principles and postulates, not
trying  to  explain  the  empirical  data  that  experimental  physicists  studying
cathode rays had begun to gather about the relation of mass to the velocity
of particles. Coupling Maxwell�s theory with the relativity theory, he began

 
 
(not surprisingly) with a thought experiment. He calculated the properties of
two  light  pulses  emitted  in  opposite  directions  by  a  body  at  rest.  He  then
calculated the properties of these light pulses when observed from a moving
frame  of  reference.  From  this  he  came  up  with  equations  regarding  the
relationship between speed and mass.

The  result  was  an  elegant  conclusion:  mass  and  energy  are  different
manifestations of the same thing. There is a fundamental interchangeability
between the two. As he put it in his paper, �The mass of a body is a measure
of its energy content.�

The  formula  he  used  to  describe  this  relationship  was  also  strikingly
simple:  �If  a  body  emits  the  energy  L  in  the  form  of  radiation,  its  mass
decreases  by  L/V  2.�  Or,  to  express  the  same  equation  in  a  different
manner:L=mV  2. Einstein  used the  letter L  to  represent  energy  until  1912,
when  he  crossed  it  out  in  a  manuscript  and  replaced  it  with  the  more
common  E.  He  also  used  V  to  represent  the  velocity  of  light,  before
changing  to  the  more  common  c.  So,  using  the  letters  that  soon  became
standard, Einstein had come up with his memorable equation:

E=mc 2

Energy  equals  mass  times  the  square  of  the  speed  of  light.  The  speed  of
light, of course, is huge. Squared it is almost inconceivably bigger. That is
why  a  tiny  amount  of  matter,  if  converted  completely  into  energy,  has  an
enormous punch. A kilogram of mass would convert into approximately 25
billion kilowatt hours of electricity. More vividly: the energy in the mass of
one raisin could supply most of New York City�s energy needs for a day.83

As usual, Einstein ended by proposing experimental ways to confirm the
theory  he  had  just  derived.  �Perhaps  it  will  prove  possible,�  he  wrote,�to
test  this  theory  using  bodies  whose  energy  content  is  variable  to  a  high
degree, e.g., salts of radium.�

 
CHAPTER SEVEN
THE HAPPIEST THOUGHT
1906�1909

Recognition

Einstein�s  1905  burst  of  creativity  was  astonishing.  He  had  devised  a
revolutionary quantum theory of light, helped prove the existence of atoms,
explained  Brownian  motion,  upended  the  concept  of  space  and  time,  and
produced what would become science�s best known equation. But not many
people seemed to notice at first. According to his sister, Einstein had hoped
that  his  flurry  of  essays  in  a  preeminent  journal  would  lift  him  from  the
obscurity  of  a  third-class  patent  examiner  and  provide  some  academic
recognition,  perhaps  even  an  academic  job.  �But  he  was  bitterly
disappointed,� she noted. �Icy silence followed the publication.�1

That was not exactly true. A small but respectable handful of physicists
soon  took  note  of  Einstein�s  papers,  and  one  of  these  turned  out  to  be,  as
good fortune would have it, the most important possible admirer he could
attract:  Max  Planck,  Europe�s  revered  monarch  of  theoretical  physics,
whose  mysterious  mathematical  constant  explaining  black-body  radiation
Einstein  had  transformed  into  a  radical  new  reality  of  nature.  As  the
editorial  board  member  of  Annalen  der  Physik  responsible  for  theoretical
submissions, Planck had vetted Einstein�s papers, and the one on relativity
had �immediately aroused my lively attention,� he later recalled. As soon as
it  was  published,  Planck  gave  a  lecture  on  relativity  at  the  University  of
Berlin.2

Planck  became  the  first  physicist  to  build  on  Einstein�s  theory.  In  an
article published in the spring of 1906, he argued that relativity conformed

 
 
to the principle of least action, a foundation of physics that holds that light
or any object moving between two points should follow the easiest path.3

Planck�s  paper  not  only  contributed  to  the  development  of  relativity
theory;  it  also  helped  to  legitimize  it  among  other  physicists.  Whatever
disappointment  Maja  Einstein  had  detected  in  her  brother  dissipated.  �My
papers are much appreciated and are giving rise to further investigations,�
he exulted to Solovine. �Professor Planck has recently written to me about
that.�4

The proud patent examiner was soon exchanging letters with the eminent
professor.  When  another  theorist  challenged  Planck�s  contention  that
relativity  theory  conformed  to  the  principle  of  least  action,  Einstein  took
Planck�s side and sent him a card saying so. Planck was pleased. �As long
as the proponents of the principle of relativity constitute such a modest little
band as is now the case,� he replied to Einstein, �it is doubly important that
they  agree  among  themselves.�  He  added  that  he  hoped  to  visit  Bern  the
following year and meet Einstein personally.5

Planck  did  not  end  up  coming  to  Bern,  but  he  did  send  his  earnest
assistant,  Max  Laue.*  He  and  Einstein  had  already  been  corresponding
about  Einstein�s  light  quanta  paper,  with  Laue  saying  that  he  agreed  with
�your  heuristic  view  that  radiation  can  be  absorbed  and  emitted  only  in
specific finite quanta.�

However,  Laue  insisted,  just  as  Planck  had,  that  Einstein  was  wrong  to
assume  that  these  quanta  were  a  characteristic  of  the  radiation  itself.
Instead,  Laue  contended  that  the  quanta  were  merely  a  description  of  the
way that radiation was emitted or absorbed by a piece of matter. �This is not
a characteristic of electromagnetic processes in a vacuum but rather of the
emitting  or  absorbing  matter,�  Laue  wrote,  �and  hence  radiation  does  not
consist of light quanta as it says in section six of your first paper.�6 (In that
section, Einstein had said that the radiation �behaves thermodynamically as
if it consisted of mutually independent energy quanta.�)

When  Laue  was  preparing  to  visit  in  the  summer  of  1907,  he  was
surprised to discover that Einstein was not at the University of Bern but was
working  at  the  patent  office  on  the  third  floor  of  the  Post  and  Telegraph
Building.  Meeting  Einstein  there  did  not  lessen  his  wonder.  �The  young
man who came to meet me made so unexpected an impression on me that I
did  not  believe  he  could  possibly  be  the  father  of  the  relativity  theory,�

Laue  said,  �so  I  let  him  pass.�  After  a  while,  Einstein  came  wandering
through the reception area again, and Laue finally realized who he was.

They walked and talked for hours, with Einstein at one point offering a
cigar that, Laue recalled, �was so unpleasant that I �accidentally� dropped it
into  the  river.�  Einstein�s  theories,  on  the  other  hand,  made  a  pleasing
impression.  �During  the  first  two  hours  of  our  conversation  he  overthrew
the entire mechanics and electrodynamics,� Laue noted. Indeed, he was so
enthralled  that  over  the  next  four  years  he  would  publish  eight  papers  on
Einstein�s relativity theory and become a close friend.7

Some theorists found the amazing flurry of papers from the patent office
to  be  uncomfortably  abstract.  Arnold  Sommerfeld,  later  a  friend,  was
among  the  first  to  suggest  there  was  something  Jewish  about  Einstein�s
theoretical approach, a theme later picked up by anti-Semites. It lacked due
respect  for  the  notion  of  order  and  absolutes,  and  it  did  not  seem  solidly
grounded.  �As  remarkable  as  Einstein�s  papers  are,�  he  wrote  Lorentz  in
1907,  �it  still  seems  to  me  that  something  almost  unhealthy  lies  in  this
unconstruable  and  impossible  to  visualize  dogma.  An  Englishman  would
hardly  have  given  us  this  theory.  It  might  be  here  too,  as  in  the  case  of
Cohn, the abstract conceptual character of the Semite expresses itself.�8

None  of  this  interest  made  Einstein  famous,  nor  did  it  get  him  any  job
offers. �I was surprised to read that you must sit in an office for eight hours
a  day,�  wrote  yet  another  young  physicist  who  was  planning  to  visit.
�History  is  full  of  bad  jokes.�9  But  because  he  had  finally  earned  his
doctorate,  he  had  at  least  gotten  promoted  from  a  third-class  to  a  second-
class technical expert at the patent office, which came with a hefty 1,000-
franc raise to an annual salary of 4,500 francs.10

His productivity was startling. In addition to working six days a week at
the patent office, he continued his torrent of papers and reviews: six in 1906
and  ten  more  in  1907.  At  least  once  a  week  he  played  in  a  string  quartet.
And  he  was  a  good  father  to  the  3-year-old  son  he  proudly  labeled
�impertinent.�  As  Mari   wrote  to  her  friend  Helene  Savi ,  �My  husband
often spends his free time at home just playing with the boy.�11

Beginning in the summer of 1907, Einstein also found time to dabble in
what might have become, if the fates had been more impish, a new career
path:  as  an  inventor  and  salesman  of  electrical  devices  like  his  uncle  and
father.  Working  with  Olympia  Academy  member  Conrad  Habicht  and  his
brother  Paul,  Einstein  developed  a  machine  to  amplify  tiny  electrical

charges so they could be measured and studied. It had more academic than
practical purpose; the idea was to create a lab device that would permit the
study of small electrical fluctuations.

The  concept  was  simple.  When  two  strips  of  metal  move  close  to  each
other, an electric charge on one will induce an opposite charge on the other.
Einstein�s idea was to use a series of strips that would induce the charge ten
times and then transfer that to another disc. The process would be repeated
until the original minuscule charge would be multiplied by a large number
and  thus  be  easily  measurable.  The  trick  was  making  the  contraption
actually work.12

Given his heritage, breeding, and years in the patent office, Einstein had
the  background  to  be  an  engineering  genius.  But  as  it  turned  out,  he  was
better suited to theorizing. Fortunately, Paul Habicht was a good machinist,
and  by  August  1907  he  had  a  prototype  of  the  Maschinchen,  or  little
machine, ready to be unveiled. �I am astounded at the lightning speed with
which  you  built  the  Maschinchen,�  Einstein  wrote.  �I�ll  show  up  on
Sunday.� Unfortunately, it didn�t work. �I am driven by murderous curiosity
as to  what you�re  up to,�  Einstein  wrote a month later  as they  tried  to  fix
things.

Throughout  1908,  letters  flew  back  and  forth  between  Einstein  and  the
Habichts,  filled  with  complex  diagrams  and  a  torrent  of  ideas  for  how  to
make the device work. Einstein published a description in a journal, which
produced, for a while, a potential sponsor. Paul Habicht was able to build a
better version by October, but it had trouble keeping a charge. He brought
the  machine  to  Bern,  where  Einstein  commandeered  a  lab  in  one  of  the
schools  and  dragooned  a  local  mechanic.  By  November  the  machine
seemed to be working. It took another year or so to get a patent and begin to
make  some  versions  for  sale.  But  even  then,  it  never  truly  caught  hold  or
found a market, and Einstein eventually lost interest.13

These  practical  exploits  may  have  been  fun,  but  Einstein�s  glorious
isolation  from  the  priesthood  of  academic  physicists  was  starting  to  have
more drawbacks than advantages. In a paper he wrote in the spring of 1907,
he began by exuding a joyful self-assurance about having neither the library
nor  the  inclination  to  know  what  other  theorists  had  written  on  the  topic.
�Other authors might have already clarified part of what I am going to say,�
he  wrote.  �I  felt  I  could  dispense  with  doing  a  literature  search  (which
would have been very troublesome  for  me), especially  since  there is  good

reason  to  hope  that  others  will  fill  this  gap.�  However,  when  he  was
commissioned to write a major year-book piece on relativity later that year,
there was slightly less cockiness in his warning to the editor that he might
not  be aware of all the  literature. �Unfortunately I  am  not  in  a position  to
acquaint myself about everything that has been published on this subject,�
he wrote, �because the library is closed in my free time.�14

That  year  he  applied  for  a  position  at  the  University  of  Bern  as  a
privatdozent, a starter rung on the academic ladder, which involved giving
lectures and collecting a small fee from anyone who felt like showing up.
To  become  a  professor  at  most  European  universities,  it  helped  to  serve
such  an  apprenticeship.  With  his  application  Einstein  enclosed  seventeen
papers he had published, including the ones on relativity and light quanta.
He  was  also  expected  to  include  an  unpublished  paper  known  as  a
habilitation  thesis,  but  he  decided  not  to  bother  writing  one,  as  this
requirement  was  sometimes  waived  for  those  who  had  �other  outstanding
achievements.�

Only  one  professor  on  the  faculty  committee  supported  hiring  him
without  requiring  him  to  write  a  new  thesis,  �in  view  of  the  important
scientific  achievements  of  Herr  Einstein.�  The  others  disagreed,  and  the
requirement  was  not  waived.  Not  surprisingly,  Einstein  considered  the
matter �amusing.� He did not write the special habilitation or get the post.15

The Equivalence of Gravity and Acceleration

Einstein�s  road  to  the  general  theory  of  relativity  began  in  November
1907,  when  he  was  struggling  against  a  deadline  to  finish  an  article  for  a
science yearbook explaining his special theory of relativity. Two limitations
of  that  theory  still  bothered  him:  it  applied  only  to  uniform  constant-
velocity  motion  (things  felt  and  behaved  differently  if  your  speed  or
direction  was  changing),  and  it  did  not  incorporate  Newton�s  theory  of
gravity.

�I was sitting in a chair in the patent office at Bern when all of a sudden a
thought  occurred  to  me,�  he  recalled.  �If  a  person  falls  freely,  he  will  not
feel his  own weight.�That  realization, which �startled�  him, launched  him
on an arduous eight-year effort to generalize his special theory of relativity

 
and  �impelled  me  toward  a  theory  of  gravitation.�16  Later,  he  would
grandly call it �the happiest* thought in my life.�17

The  tale  of  the  falling  man  has  become  an  iconic  one,  and  in  some
accounts  it  actually  involves  a  painter  who  fell  from  the  roof  of  an
apartment building near the patent office.18 In fact, probably like other great
tales  of gravitational  discovery�Galileo  dropping  objects  from the  Tower
of  Pisa  and  the  apple  falling  on  Newton�s  head19�it  was  embellished  in
popular lore and was more of a thought experiment than a real occurrence.
Despite  Einstein�s  propensity  to  focus  on  science  rather  than  the  merely
personal, even he was not likely to watch a real human plunging off a roof
and  think  of  gravitational  theory,  much  less  call  it  the  happiest  thought  in
his life.

Einstein refined his thought experiment so that the falling man was in an
enclosed  chamber,  such  as  an  elevator  in  free  fall  above  the  earth.  In  this
falling  chamber  (at  least  until  it  crashed),  the  man  would  feel  weightless.
Any objects he emptied from his pocket and let loose would float alongside
him.

Looking  at  it  another  way,  Einstein  imagined  a  man  in  an  enclosed
chamber  floating  in  deep  space  �far  removed  from  stars  and  other
appreciable  masses.�  He  would  experience  the  same  perceptions  of
weightlessness.  �Gravitation  naturally  does  not  exist  for  this  observer.  He
must fasten himself with strings to the floor, otherwise the slightest impact
against the floor will cause him to rise slowly towards the ceiling.�

Then  Einstein  imagined  that  a  rope  was  hooked  onto  the  roof  of  the
chamber and pulled up with a constant force. �The chamber together with
the  observer  then  begin  to  move  �upwards�  with  a  uniformly  accelerated
motion.�The man inside will feel himself pressed to the floor. �He is then
standing in the chest in exactly the same way as anyone stands in a room of
a house on our earth.� If he pulls something from his pocket and lets go, it
will fall to the floor �with an accelerated relative motion� that is the same
no matter the weight of the object�just as Galileo discovered to be the case
for gravity. �The man in the chamber will thus come to the conclusion that
he and the chest are in a gravitational field. Of course he will be puzzled for
a moment as to why the chest does not fall in this gravitational field. Just
then,  however,  he  discovers  the  hook  in  the  middle  of  the  lid  of  the  chest
and  the  rope  which  is  attached  to  it,  and  he  consequently  comes  to  the
conclusion that the chamber is suspended at rest in the gravitational field.�

�Ought we  to  smile at  the  man  and say that he errs  in  his  conclusion?�
Einstein asked. Just as with special relativity, there was no right or wrong
perception.  �We  must  rather  admit  that  his  mode  of  grasping  the  situation
violates neither reason nor known mechanical laws.�20

A related way that Einstein addressed this same issue was typical of his
ingenuity:  he  examined  a  phenomenon  that  was  so  very  well-known  that
scientists  rarely  puzzled  about  it.  Every  object  has  a  �gravitational  mass,�
which  determines  its  weight  on  the  earth�s  surface  or,  more  generally,  the
tug  between  it  and  any  other  object.  It  also  has  an  �inertial  mass,�  which
determines  how  much  force  must  be  applied  to  it  in  order  to  make  it
accelerate.  As  Newton  noted,  the  inertial  mass  of  an  object  is  always  the
same  as  its  gravitational  mass,  even  though  they  are  defined  differently.
This  was  obviously  more  than  a  mere  coincidence,  but  no  one  had  fully
explained why.

Uncomfortable  with  two  explanations  for  what  seemed  to  be  one
phenomenon,  Einstein  probed  the  equivalence  of  inertial  mass  and
gravitational  mass  using  his  thought  experiment.  If  we  imagine  that  the
enclosed  elevator  is  being  accelerated  upward  in  a  region  of  outer  space
where there is no gravity, then the downward force felt by the man inside
(or the force that tugs downward on an object hanging from the ceiling by a
string) is due to inertial mass. If we imagine that the enclosed elevator is at
rest in a gravitational field, then the downward force felt by the man inside
(or the force that tugs downward on an object hanging from the ceiling by a
string)  is  due  to  gravitational  mass.  But  inertial  mass  always  equals
gravitational  mass.  �From  this  correspondence,�  said  Einstein,  �it  follows
that  it  is  impossible  to  discover  by  experiment  whether  a  given  system  of
coordinates is accelerated, or whether . . . the observed effects are due to a
gravitational field.�21

Einstein  called  this  �the  equivalence  principle.�22  The  local  effects  of
gravity and of acceleration are equivalent. This became a foundation for his
attempt to generalize his theory of relativity so that it was not restricted just
to  systems  that  moved  with  a  uniform  velocity.  The  basic  insight  that  he
would develop over the next eight years was that �the effects we ascribe to
gravity and the effects we ascribe to acceleration are both produced by one
and the same structure.�23

Einstein�s  approach  to  general  relativity  again  showed  how  his  mind

tended to work:

� He was disquieted when there were two seemingly unrelated theories
for the same observable phenomenon. That had been the case with
the  moving  coil  or  moving  magnet  producing  the  same  observable
electric  current,  which  he  resolved  with  the  special  theory  of
relativity.  Now  it  was  the  case  with  the  differing  definitions  of
inertial  mass  and gravitational  mass,  which he began to  resolve by
building on the equivalence principle.

� He was likewise uncomfortable when a theory made distinctions that
could  not  be  observed  in  nature.  That  had  been  the  case  with
observers in uniform motion: there was no way of determining who
was at rest and who was in motion. Now it was also, apparently, the
case for observers in accelerated motion: there was no way of telling
who was accelerating and who was in a gravitational field.

�  He  was  eager  to  generalize  theories  rather  than  settling  for  having
them restricted to a special case. There should not, he felt, be one set
of principles for the special case of constant-velocity motion and a
different  set  for  all  other  types  of  motion.  His  life  was  a  constant
quest for unifying theories.

In  November  1907,  working  against  the  deadline  imposed  by  the
Yearbook of Radioactivity and Electronics, Einstein tacked on a fifth section
to his article on relativity that sketched out his new ideas. �So far we have
applied  the  principle  of  relativity  ...only  to  nonaccelerated  reference
systems,� he began. �Is it conceivable that the principle of relativity applies
to systems that are accelerated relative to each other?�

Imagine two environments, he said, one being accelerated and the other
resting  in  a  gravitational  field.24  There  is  no  physical  experiment  you  can
do that would tell these situations apart. �In the discussion that follows, we
shall therefore assume the complete physical equivalence of a gravitational
field and a corresponding acceleration of the reference system.�

Using  various  mathematical  calculations  that  can  be  made  about  an
accelerated  system,  Einstein  proceeded  to  show  that,  if  his  notions  were
correct, clocks would run more slowly in a more intense gravitational field.
He also came up with many predictions that could be tested, including that
light  should  be  bent  by  gravity  and  that  the  wavelength  of  light  emitted
from a source with a large mass, such as the sun, should increase slightly in
what has become known as the gravitational redshift. �On the basis of some

ruminating, which, though daring, does have something going for it, I have
arrived  at  the  view  that  the  gravitational  difference  might  be  the  cause  of
the  shift  to  the  red  end  of  the  spectrum,�  he  explained  to  a  colleague.  �A
bending of light rays by gravity also follows from these arguments.�25

It would take Einstein another eight years, until November 1915, to work
out the fundamentals of this theory and find the math to express it. Then it
would take another four years before the most vivid of his predictions, the
extent  to  which  gravity  would  bend  light,  was  verified  by  dramatic
observations. But at least Einstein now had a vision, one that started him on
the road toward one of the most elegant and impressive achievements in the
history of physics: the general theory of relativity.

Winning a Professorship

By  the  beginning  of  1908,  even  as  such  academic  stars  as  Max  Planck
and  Wilhelm  Wien  were  writing  to  ask  for  his  insights,  Einstein  had
tempered his aspirations to be a university professor. Instead, he had begun,
believe it or not, to seek work as a high school teacher. �This craving,� he
told  Marcel  Grossmann,  who  had  helped  him  get  the  patent-office  job,
�comes  only  from  my  ardent  wish  to  be  able  to  continue  my  private
scientific work under easier conditions.�

He  was  even  eager  to  go  back  to  the  Technical  School  in  Winter-hur,
where  he  had  briefly  been  a  substitute  teacher.  �How  does  one  go  about
this?�  he  asked  Grossmann.  �Could  I  possibly  call  on  somebody  and  talk
him into the great worth of my admirable person as a teacher and a citizen?
Wouldn�t  I  make  a  bad  impression  on  him  (no  Swiss-German  dialect,  my
Semitic  appearance,  etc.)?�  He  had  written  papers  that  were  transforming
physics, but he did not know if that would help. �Would there be any point
in my stressing my scientific papers on that occasion?�26

He also responded to an advertisement for a �teacher of mathematics and
descriptive geometry� at a high school in Zurich, noting in his application
�that I would be ready to teach physics as well.� He ended up deciding to
enclose all of the papers he had written thus far, including the special theory
of relativity. There were twenty-one applicants. Einstein did not even make
the list of three finalists.27

 
So  Einstein  finally  overcame  his  pride  and  decided  to  write  a  thesis  in
order to become a privatdozent at Bern. As he explained to the patron there
who  had  supported  him,  �The  conversation  I  had  with  you  in  the  city
library, as well as the advice of several friends, has induced me to change
my decision for the second time and to try my luck with a habilitation at the
University of Bern after all.�28

The paper he submitted, an extension of his revolutionary work on light
quanta,  was  promptly  accepted,  and  at  the  end  of  February  1908,  he  was
made  a privatdozent.  He  had  finally  scaled  the  walls,  or  at  least  the  outer
wall,  of  academe.  But  his  post  neither  paid  enough  nor  was  important
enough  for  him  to  give  up  his  job  at  the  patent  office.  His  lectures  at  the
University of Bern thus became simply one more thing for him to do.

His topic for the summer of 1908 was the theory of heat, held on Tuesday
and  Saturday  at  7  a.m.,  and  he  initially  attracted  only  three  attendees:
Michele Besso and two other colleagues who worked at the postal building.
In  the  winter  session  he  switched  to  the  theory  of  radiation,  and  his  three
coworkers  were  joined  by  an  actual  student  named  Max  Stern.  By  the
summer  of  1909,  Stern  was  the  only  attendee,  and  Einstein  canceled  his
lecturing.  He  had,  in  the  meantime,  begun  to  adopt  his  professorial  look:
both  his  hair  and  clothing  became  a  victim  of  nature�s  tendency  toward
randomness.29

Alfred  Kleiner,  the  University  of  Zurich  physics  professor  who  helped
Einstein  get  his  doctorate,  had  encouraged  him  to  pursue  the  privatdozent
position.30  He  also  had  waged  a  long  effort,  which  succeeded  in  1908,  to
convince  the  Zurich  authorities  to  increase  the  university�s  stature  by
creating  a  new  position  in  theoretical  physics.  It  was  not  a  full
professorship; instead, it was an associate professorship under Kleiner.

It was the obvious post for Einstein, but there was one obstacle. Kleiner
had  another  candidate  in  mind:  his  assistant  Friedrich  Adler,  a  pale  and
passionate  political  activist  who  had  become  friends  with  Einstein  when
they were both at the Polytechnic. Adler, whose father was the leader of the
Social  Democratic  Party  in  Austria,  was  more  disposed  to  political
philosophy than theoretical physics. So he went to see Kleiner one morning
in  June 1908, and the  two of them concluded  that Adler was  not  right  for
the job and Einstein was.

In  a  letter  to  his  father,  Adler  recounted  the  conversation  and  said  that
Einstein  �had  no  understanding  how  to  relate  to  people�  and  had  been

�treated  by  the  professors  at  the  Polytechnic  with  outright  contempt.�  But
Adler said he deserved the job because of his genius and was likely to get it.
�They have a bad conscience over how they treated him earlier. The scandal
is being felt not only here but in Germany that such a man would have to sit
in the patent office.�31

Adler made sure that the Zurich authorities, and for that matter everyone
else,  knew  that  he  was  officially  stepping  aside  for  his  friend.  �If  it  is
possible to get a man like Einstein for our university, it would be absurd to
appoint me,� he wrote. That resolved the political issue for the councilor in
charge  of  education,  who  was  a  partisan  Social  Democrat.  �Ernst  would
have liked Adler, since he was a fellow party member,� Einstein explained
to  Michele  Besso.  �But  Adler�s  statements  about  himself  and  me  made  it
impossible.�32

So, at the end of June 1908, Kleiner traveled from Zurich to Bern to audit
one of Einstein�s privatdozent lectures and, as Einstein put it, �size up the
beast.�  Alas,  it  was  not  a  great  show.  �I  really  did  not  lecture  divinely,�
Einstein  lamented  to  a  friend,  �partly  because  I  was  not  well  prepared,
partly  because  being  investigated  got  on  my  nerves  a  bit.�  Kleiner  sat
listening  with  a  wrinkled  brow,  and  after  the  lecture  he  informed  Einstein
that  his  teaching  style  was  not  good  enough  to  qualify  him  for  the
professorship.  Einstein  calmly  claimed  that  he  considered  the  job  �quite
unnecessary.�33

Kleiner  went  back  to  Zurich  and  reported  that  Einstein  �holds
monologues� and was �a long way from being a teacher.� That seemed to
end his chances. As Adler informed his powerful father, �The situation has
therefore changed, and the Einstein business is closed.� Einstein pretended
to be sanguine. �The business with the professorship fell through, but that�s
all  right  with  me,�  he  wrote  a  friend.  �There  are  enough  teachers  even
without me.�34

In fact Einstein was upset, and he became even more so when he heard
that  Kleiner�s  criticism  of  his  teaching  skills  was  being  widely  circulated,
even  in  Germany.  So  he  wrote  to  Kleiner,  angrily  reproaching  him  �for
spreading unfavorable rumors about me.� He was already finding it difficult
to  get  a  proper  academic  job,  and  Kleiner�s  assessment  would  make  it
impossible.

There  was  some  validity  to  Kleiner�s  criticism.  Einstein  was  never  an
inspired teacher, and his lectures tended to be regarded as disorganized until

his  celebrity  ensured  that  every  stumble  he  made  was  transformed  into  a
charming  anecdote.  Nevertheless,  Kleiner  relented.  He  said  that  he  would
be  pleased  to  help  him  get  the  Zurich  job  if  he  could  only  show  �some
teaching ability.�

Einstein  replied  by  suggesting  that  he  come  to  Zurich  to  give  a  full-
fledged (and presumably well-prepared) lecture to the physics society there,
which he did in February 1909. �I was lucky,� Einstein reported soon after.
�Contrary to my habit, I lectured well on that occasion.�35 When he went to
call  on  Kleiner  afterward,  the  professor  intimated  that  a  job  offer  would
soon follow.

A few days after Einstein returned to Bern, Kleiner provided his official
recommendation to the University of Zurich faculty. �Einstein ranks among
the  most  important  theoretical  physicists  and  has  been  recognized  as  such
since  his  work  on  the  relativity  principle,�  he  wrote.  As  for  Einstein�s
teaching  skills,  he  said  as  politely  as  possible  that  they  were  ripe  for
improvement: �Dr. Einstein will prove his worth also as a teacher, because
he  is  too  intelligent  and  too  conscientious  not  to  be  open  to  advice  when
necessary.�36

One issue was Einstein�s Jewishness. Some faculty members considered
this a potential problem, but they were assured by Kleiner that Einstein did
not exhibit the �unpleasant peculiarities� supposedly associated with Jews.
Their  conclusion  is  a  revealing  look  at  both  the  anti-Semitism  of  the  time
and the attempts to rise above it:

The  expressions  of  our  colleague  Kleiner,  based  on  several  years  of
personal contact, were all the more valuable for the committee as well
as for the faculty as a whole since Herr Dr. Einstein is an Israelite and
since  precisely  to  the  Israelites  among  scholars  are  inscribed  (in
numerous  cases  not  entirely  without  cause)  all  kinds  of  unpleasant
peculiarities  of  character,  such  as  intrusiveness,  impudence,  and  a
shopkeeper�s mentality in the perception of their academic position. It
should be said, however, that also among the Israelites there exist men
who do not exhibit a trace of these disagreeable qualities and that it is
not proper, therefore, to disqualify a man only because he happens to
be  a  Jew.  Indeed,  one  occasionally  finds  people  also  among  non-
Jewish  scholars  who  in  regard  to  a  commercial  perception  and
utilization  of  their  academic  profession  develop  qualities  that  are

usually  considered  as  specifically  Jewish.  Therefore,  neither  the
committee nor the faculty as a whole considered it compatible with its
dignity to adopt anti-Semitism as a matter of policy.37

The  secret  faculty  vote  in  late  March  1909  was  ten  in  favor  and  one
abstention. Einstein  was  offered  his  first  professorship,  four  years  after he
had revolutionized physics. Unfortunately, his proposed salary was less than
what he was making at the patent office, so he declined. Finally, the Zurich
authorities raised their  offer, and Einstein  accepted. �So,  now I  too  am  an
official member of the guild of whores,� he exulted to a colleague.38

One  person  who  saw  a  newspaper  notice  about  Einstein�s  appointment
was a Basel housewife named Anna Meyer-Schmid. Ten years earlier, when
she  was  an  unmarried  girl  of  17,  they  had  met  during  one  of  Einstein�s
vacations  with  his  mother  at  the  Hotel  Paradies.  Most  of  the  guests  had
seemed to him �philistines,� but he took a liking to Anna and even wrote a
poem in her album: �What should I inscribe for you here? / I could think of
many things / Including a kiss / On your tiny little mouth / If you�re angry
about it / Do not start to cry / The best punishment / Is to give me one too.�
He signed it, �Your rascally friend.�39

In response to a congratulatory postcard from her, Einstein replied with a
polite  and  mildly  suggestive  letter.  �I  probably  cherish  the  memory  of  the
lovely  weeks  that  I  was  allowed  to  spend  near  you  in  the  Paradies  more
than you do,� he wrote. �So now I�ve become such a big schoolmaster that
my  name  is  even  mentioned  in  the  newspapers.  But  I  have  remained  a
simple fellow.� He noted that he had married his college friend Mari , but
he gave her his office address. �If you ever happen to be in Zurich and have
time, look me up there; it would give me great pleasure.�40

Whether  or  not  Einstein  intended  his  response  to  hover  uncertainly
between  innocence  and  suggestiveness,  Anna�s  eyes  apparently  snapped  it
into  the  latter  position.  She  wrote  a  letter  back,  which  Mari   intercepted.
Her jealousy aroused, Mari  then wrote a letter to Anna�s husband claiming
(wishfully  more  than  truthfully)  that  Einstein  was  outraged  by  Anna�s
�inappropriate letter� and brazen attempt to rekindle a relationship.

Einstein  ended  up  having  to  calm  matters  with  an  apology  to  the
husband.  �I  am  very  sorry  if  I  have  caused  you  distress  by  my  careless
behavior,� he wrote. �I answered the congratulatory card your wife sent me
on  the  occasion  of  my  appointment  too  heartily  and  thereby  re-awakened

 
the old affection we had for each other. But this was not done with impure
intentions. The behavior of your wife, for whom I have the greatest respect,
was  totally  honorable.  It  was  wrong  of  my  wife�and  excusable  only  on
account of extreme jealousy�to behave�without my knowledge�the way
she did.�

Although the incident itself was of no consequence, it marked a turn in
Einstein�s  relationship  with  Mari .  In  his  eyes,  her  brooding  jealousy  was
making  her  darker.  Decades  later,  still  rankling  at  Mari �s  behavior,  he
wrote to Anna�s daughter asserting, with a brutal bluntness, that his wife�s
jealousy  had  been  a  pathological  flaw  typical  of  a  woman  of  such
�uncommon ugliness.�41

Mari   indeed  had  a  jealous  streak.  She  resented  not  only  her  husband�s
flirtations  with  other  women  but  also  the  time  he  spent  with  male
colleagues.  Now  that  he  had  become  a  professor,  she  succumbed  to  a
professional  envy  that  was  understandable  given  her  own  curtailed
scientific career. �With that kind of fame, he does not have much time left
for  his  wife,�  she told her friend Helene Savi . �You wrote that I  must be
jealous of science. But what can you do? One gets the pearl, the other the
box.�

In  particular,  Mari   worried  that  her  husband�s  fame  would  make  him
colder and more self-centered. �I am very happy for his success, because he
really does deserve it,� she wrote in another letter. �I only hope that fame
does not exert a detrimental influence on his human side.�42

In  one  sense,  Mari �s  worries  proved  unwarranted.  Even  as  his  fame
increased  exponentially,  Einstein  would  retain  a  personal  simplicity,  an
unaffected style, and at least a veneer of genial humility. But viewed from a
different  reference  frame,  there  were  transformations  to  his  human  side.
Sometime  around  1909,  he  began  drifting  apart  from  his  wife.  His
resistance to chains and bonds increasingly led him to escape into his work
while taking a detached approach to the realm he dismissed as �the merely
personal.�

On one of his last days working at the patent office, he received a large
envelope  with  an  elegant  sheet  covered  in  what  seemed  to  be  Latin
calligraphy.  Because  it  seemed  odd  and  impersonal,  he  threw  it  in  the
wastebasket.  It  was,  in  fact,  an  invitation  to  be  one  of  those  receiving  an
honorary  doctorate  at  the  July  1909  commemoration  of  the  founding  of
Geneva�s university, and authorities there finally got a friend of Einstein to

persuade him to attend. Einstein brought only a straw hat and an informal
suit, so he stood out rather strangely, both in the parade and at the opulent
formal  dinner  that  night.  Amused  by  the  whole  situation,  he  turned  to  the
patrician  seated  next  to  him  and  speculated  about  the  austere  Protestant
Reformation  leader  who  had  founded  the  university:  �Do  you  know  what
Calvin would have done had he been here?� The gentleman, befuddled, said
no. Einstein replied, �He would have erected an enormous stake and had us
all burnt for our sinful extravagance.� As Einstein later recalled,�The man
never addressed another word to me.�43

Light Can Be Wave and Particle

Also at the end of the summer of 1909, Einstein was invited to address
the  annual  Naturforscher  conference,  the  preeminent  meeting  of  German-
speaking  scientists,  which  was  held  that  year  in  Salzburg.  Organizers  had
put both relativity and the quantum nature of light on the agenda, and they
expected  him  to  speak  on  the  former.  Instead,  Einstein  decided  that  he
preferred to emphasize what he considered the more pressing issue: how to
interpret quantum theory and reconcile it with the wave theory of light that
Maxwell had so elegantly formulated.

After  his  �happiest  thought�  at  the  end  of  1907  about  how  the
equivalence  of  gravity  and  acceleration  might  lead  to  a  generalization  of
relativity theory, Einstein had put that subject aside to focus instead on what
he  called  �the  radiation  problem�  (i.e.,  quantum  theory).  The  more  he
thought  about  his  �heuristic�  notion  that  light  was  made  up  of  quanta,  or
indivisible packets, the more he worried that he and Planck had wrought a
revolution  that  would  destroy  the  classical  foundations  of  physics,
especially  Maxwell�s  equations.  �I  have  come  to  this  pessimistic  view
mainly as a result of endless, vain efforts to interpret . . . Planck�s constant
in  an  intuitive  way,�  he  wrote  a  fellow  physicist  early  in  1908.  �I  even
seriously  doubt  that  it  will  be  possible  to  maintain  the  general  validity  of
Maxwell�s equations.�44 (As it turned out, his love of Maxwell�s equations
was well placed. They are among the few elements of theoretical physics to
remain  unchanged  by  both  the  relativity  and  quantum  revolutions  that
Einstein helped launch.)

 
When  Einstein,  still  not  officially  a  professor,  arrived  at  the  Salzburg
conference in September 1909, he finally met Max Planck and other giants
that he had known only through letters. On the afternoon of the third day, he
stepped  in  front  of  more  than  a  hundred  famed  scientists  and  delivered  a
speech  that  Wolfgang  Pauli,  who  was  to  become  a  pioneer  of  quantum
mechanics, later pronounced �one of the landmarks in the development of
theoretical physics.�

Einstein began by explaining how the wave theory of light was no longer
complete.  Light  (or  any  radiation)  could  also  be  regarded,  he  said,  as  a
beam  of  particles  or  packets  of  energy,  which  he  said  was  akin  to  what
Newton  had  posited.  �Light  has  certain  basic  properties  that  can  be
understood  more  readily  from  the  standpoint  of  the  Newtonian  emission
theory  than  from  the  standpoint  of  the  wave  theory,�  he  declared.  �I  thus
believe that the next phase of theoretical physics will bring us a theory of
light  that  can  be  interpreted  as  a  kind  of  fusion  of  the  wave  and  of  the
emission theories of light.�

Combining particle theory with wave theory, he warned, would bring �a
profound change.� This was not a good thing, he feared. It could undermine
the certainties and determinism inherent in classical physics.

For a moment, Einstein mused that perhaps such a fate could be avoided
by accepting Planck�s more limited interpretation of quanta: that they were
features only of how radiation was emitted and absorbed by a surface rather
than  a  feature  of  the  actual  light  wave  as  it  propagated  through  space.
�Would it not be possible,� he asked, �to retain at least the equations for the
propagation  of  radiation  and  conceive  only  the  processes  of  emission  and
absorption  differently?�  But  after  comparing  the  behavior  of  light  to  the
behavior of gas molecules, as he had done in his 1905 light quanta paper,
Einstein concluded that, alas, this was not possible.

As a result, Einstein said, light must be regarded as behaving like both an
undulating wave and a stream of particles. �These two structural properties
simultaneously  displayed  by  radiation,�  he  declared  at  the  end  of  his  talk,
�should not be considered as mutually incompatible.�45

It was the first well-conceived promulgation of the wave-particle duality
of light, and it had implications as profound as Einstein�s earlier theoretical
breakthroughs.  �Is  it  possible  to  combine  energy  quanta  and  the  wave
to  a  physicist  friend.
principles  of  radiation?�  he  merrily  wrote 

�Appearances  are  against  it,  but  the  Almighty�it  seems�managed  the
trick.�46

A vibrant  discussion  followed Einstein�s speech,  led  by Planck  himself.
Still unwilling to embrace the physical reality underlying the mathematical
constant  that  he  had  devised  nine  years  earlier,  or  to  accept  the
revolutionary  ramifications  envisioned  by  Einstein,  Planck  now  played
protector  of  the  old  order.  He  admitted  that  radiation  involved  discrete
�quanta, which are to be conceived as atoms of action.� But he insisted that
these quanta existed only as part of the process of radiation being emitted or
absorbed.  �The  question  is  where  to  look  for  these  quanta,�  he  said.
�According  to  Mr.  Einstein,  it  would  be  necessary  to  conceive  that  free
radiation  in  a  vacuum,  and  thus  the  light  waves  themselves  consist  of
atomistic quanta, and hence force us to give up Maxwell�s equations. This
seems to me a step that is not yet necessary.�47

Within two decades, Einstein would assume a similar role as protector of
the  old  order.  Indeed,  he  was  already  looking  for  ways  out  of  the  eerie
dilemmas raised by quantum theory. �I am very hopeful that I will solve the
radiation  problem,  and  that  I  will  do  so  without  light  quanta,�  he  wrote  a
young physicist he was working with.48

It was all too mystifying, at least for the time being. So as he moved up
the  professorial  ranks  in  the  German-speaking  universities  of  Europe,  he
turned his attention back to the topic that was uniquely his own, relativity,
and for a while became a refugee from the wonderland of the quanta. As he
lamented to a friend, �The more successes the quantum theory enjoys, the
sillier it looks.�49

CHAPTER EIGHT
THE WANDERING PROFESSOR
1909�1914

Zurich, 1909

As  a  self-assured  17-year-old,  Einstein  had  enrolled  at  the  Zurich
Polytechnic  and  met  Mileva  Mari ,  the  woman  he  would  marry.  Now,  in
October 1909, at age 30, he was returning to that city to take up his post as
a junior professor at the nearby University of Zurich.

Their homecoming restored, at least temporarily, some of the romance to
their  relationship.  Mari   was  thrilled  to  be  back  in  their  original  nesting
ground,  and  by  the  end  of  their  first  month  there  she  became  pregnant
again.

The  apartment  they  rented  was  in  a  building  where,  they  happily
discovered,  Friedrich  Adler  and  his  wife  lived,  and  the  couples  became
even  closer  friends.  �They  run  a  bohemian  household,�  Adler  wrote  his
father approvingly. �The more I talk to Einstein, the more I realize that my
favorable opinion of him was justified.�

The  two  men  discussed  physics  and  philosophy  most  evenings,  often
retreating  to  the  attic  of  the  three-story  building  so  they  would  not  be
disturbed by children or spouses. Adler introduced Einstein to the work of
Pierre  Duhem,  whose  1906  book  La  Th�orie  Physique  Adler  had  just
published in German. Duhem offered a more holistic approach than Mach
did to the relationship between theories and experimental evidence, one that
seemed  to  influence  Einstein  as  he  staked  out  his  own  philosophy  of
science.1

 
 
Adler  particularly  respected  Einstein�s  �most  independent�  mind.  There
was, he told his father, a nonconformist streak in Einstein that reflected an
inner  security  but  not  an  arrogance.  �We  find  ourselves  in  agreement  on
questions that the majority of physicists would not even understand,� Adler
boasted.2

Einstein tried to persuade Adler to focus on science rather than be enticed
into  politics.  �Be  a  little  patient,�  he  said.  �You  will  certainly  be  my
successor in Zurich one day.� (Einstein was already assuming that he would
move on to a more prestigious university.) But Adler ignored the advice and
decided  to  become  an  editor  at  the  Social  Democratic  Party  newspaper.
Loyalty to a party, Einstein felt, meant surrendering some independence of
thought.  Such  conformity  confounded  him.  �How  an  intelligent  man  can
subscribe  to  a  party  I  find  a  complete  mystery,�  Einstein  later  lamented
about Adler.3

Einstein  was  also  reunited  with  his  former  classmate  and  note-taker
Marcel Grossmann, who had helped him get his job at the patent office and
was now a professor of math at their old Polytechnic. Einstein would often
visit  Grossmann  after  lunch  for  help  with  the  complex  geometry  and
calculus he needed to extend relativity into a more general field theory.

Einstein was even able to forge a friendship with the other distinguished
math  professor  at  the  Polytechnic,  Adolf  Hurwitz,  whose  classes  he  had
often  skipped  and  who  had  spurned  his  plea  for  a  job.  Einstein  became  a
regular at the Sunday music recitals at Hurwitz�s home. When Hurwitz told
him  during  a  walk  one  day  that  his  daughter  had  been  given  a  math
homework  problem  she  did  not  understand,  Einstein  showed  up  that
afternoon to help her solve it.4

As Kleiner predicted, Einstein�s teaching talents improved. He was not a
polished lecturer, but instead used informality to his advantage. �When he
took  his  chair  in  shabby  attire  with  trousers  too  short  for  him,  we  were
skeptical,�  recalled  Hans  Tanner,  who  attended  most  of  Einstein�s  Zurich
lectures. Instead of prepared notes, Einstein used a card-sized strip of paper
with scribbles. So the students got to watch him develop his thoughts as he
spoke. �We obtained some insight into his working technique,� said Tanner.
�We certainly appreciated this more than any stylistically perfect lecture.�

At each step of the way, Einstein would pause and ask the students if they
were following him, and he even permitted interruptions. �This comradely
contact  between  teacher  and  student  was,  at  that  time,  a  rare  occurrence,�

according to Adolf Fisch, another who attended the lectures. Sometimes he
would  take  a  break  and  let  the  students  gather  around  him  for  casual
conversation.  �With  an  impulsiveness  and  naturalness  he  would  take
students by the arm to discuss things,� recalled Tanner.

During  one  lecture,  Einstein  found  himself  momentarily  stumped  about
the  steps  needed  to  complete  a  calculation.  �There  must  be  some  silly
mathematical transformation that I can�t find for a moment,� he said. �Can
one  of  you  gentlemen  see  it?�  Not  surprisingly,  none  of  them  could.  So
Einstein  continued:  �Then  leave  a  quarter  of  a  page.  We  won�t  lose  any
time.�Ten  minutes  later,  Einstein  interrupted  himself  in  the  middle  of
another  point  and  exclaimed,  �I�ve  got  it.�  As  Tanner  later  marveled,
�During the complicated development of his theme he had still found time
to reflect upon the nature of that particular mathematical transformation.�

At the end of many of his evening lectures, Einstein would ask, �Who�s
coming  to  the  Caf�  Terasse?�  There,  with  an  informal  cadre  on  a  terrace
overlooking the Limmat River, they would talk until closing time.

On  one  occasion,  Einstein  asked  if  anyone  wanted  to  come  back  to  his
apartment. �This morning I received some work from Planck in which there
must  be  a  mistake,�  he  said.  �We  could  read  it  together.�  Tanner  and
another  student  took  him  up  on  the  offer  and  followed  him  home.  There
they  all  pored  over  Planck�s  paper.  �See  if  you  can  spot  the  fault  while  I
make some coffee,� he said.

After  a  while,  Tanner  replied,  �You  must  be  mistaken,  Herr  Professor,

there is no error in it.�

�Yes, there is,� Einstein said, pointing to some discrepancies in the data,
�for  otherwise  that  and  that  would  become  that  and  that.�  It  was  a  vivid
example  of  Einstein�s  great  strength:  he  could  look  at  a  complex
mathematical  equation,  which  for  others  was  merely  an  abstraction,  and
picture the physical reality that lay behind it.

Tanner  was  astounded.  �Let�s  write  to  Professor  Planck,�  he  suggested,

�and tell him of the mistake.�

Einstein had by then become slightly more tactful, especially with those
he placed on a pedestal, such as Planck and Lorentz. �We won�t tell him he
made  a  mistake,�  he  said.  �The  result  is  correct,  but  the  proof  is  faulty.
We�ll  simply  write  and  tell  him  how  the  real  proof  should  run.  The  main
thing is the content, not the mathematics.�5

Despite his work on his machine to measure electrical charges, Einstein
had become a confirmed theorist rather than experimental physicist. When
he was asked during his second year as a professor to supervise laboratory
work, he was dismayed. He hardly dared, he told Tanner, �pick up a piece
of  apparatus  for  fear  it  might  blow  up.�  To  another  eminent  professor  he
confided, �My fears regarding the laboratory were rather well founded.�6

As he was finishing his first academic year at Zurich, in July 1910, Mari
gave  birth,  again  with  difficulty,  to  their  second  son,  named  Eduard  and
called Tete. She was ill for weeks afterward. Her doctor, contending that she
was overworked, suggested that Einstein find a way to make more money
and  pay  for  a  maid.  Mari   was  annoyed  and  protective.  �Isn�t  it  clear  to
anyone  that  my  husband  works  himself  half  dead?�  she  said.  Instead,  her
mother came down from Novi Sad to help.7

Throughout  his  life,  Einstein  would  sometimes  appear  aloof  toward  his
two sons, especially Eduard, who suffered from increasingly severe mental
illness as he grew older. But when they were young, he tended to be a good
father.  �When  my  mother  was  busy  around  the  house,  father  would  put
aside his work and watch over us for hours, bouncing us on his knee,� Hans
Albert  later  recalled.  �I  remember  he  would  tell  us  stories�and  he  often
played the violin in an effort to keep us quiet.�

One of his strengths as a thinker, if not as a parent, was that he had the
ability,  and  the  inclination,  to  tune  out  all  distractions,  a  category  that  to
him  sometimes  included  his  children  and  family.  �Even  the  loudest  baby-
crying  didn�t  seem  to  disturb  Father,�  Hans  Albert  said.  �He  could  go  on
with his work completely impervious to noise.�

One  day  his  student  Tanner  came  for  a  visit  and  found  Einstein  in  his
study poring over a pile of papers. He was writing with his right hand and
holding Eduard with his left. Hans Albert was playing with toy bricks and
trying  to  get  his  attention.  �Wait  a  minute,  I�ve  nearly  finished,�  Einstein
said, as he handed Eduard to Tanner and kept scribbling his equations. �It
gave  me,�  said  Tanner,  �a  glimpse  into  his  immense  powers  of
concentration.�8

Prague, 1911

 
Einstein  had  been  in  Zurich  less  than  six  months  when  he  received,  in
March  1910,  a  solicitation  to  consider  a  more  prestigious  job:  a  full
professorship  at  the  German  part  of  the  University  of  Prague.  Both  the
university and the academic position were a step up; however, moving from
the  familiar  and  friendly  Zurich  to  the  less  congenial  Prague  would  be
disruptive  for  his  family.  For  Einstein,  the  professional  considerations
outweighed the personal ones.

He  was  again  going  through  difficult  periods  at  home.  �The  bad  mood
that you noticed in me had nothing to do with you,� he wrote to his mother,
who was now living in Berlin. �To dwell on the things that depress or anger
us does not help in overcoming them. One must knock them down alone.�

His scientific work, on the other hand, was giving him great pleasure, and
he  expressed  excitement  about  his  possible  new  opportunity.  �It  is  most
probable  that  I  will  be  offered  the  position  of  full  professor  at  a  large
university with a significantly better salary than I now have.�9

When  word  of  Einstein�s  possible  move  spread  in  Zurich,  fifteen  of  his
students, led by Hans Tanner, signed a petition urging officials there �to do
your  utmost  to  keep  this  outstanding  researcher  and  teacher  at  our
university.�  They  stressed  the  importance  of  having  a  professor  in  �this
newly  created  discipline�  of  theoretical  physics,  and  they  extolled  him
personally in effusive terms. �Professor Einstein has an amazing talent for
presenting the most difficult problems of theoretical physics so clearly and
so comprehensibly that it is a great delight for us to follow his lectures, and
he is so good at establishing a perfect rapport with his audience.�10

The  Zurich  authorities  were  so  eager  to  keep  him  that  they  raised  his
salary  from  its  current  4,500  francs,  which  was  the  same  as  he  made  as  a
patent examiner, to 5,500 francs. Those attempting to lure him to Prague, on
the other hand, were having a more difficult time.

The  faculty  department  at  Prague  had  settled  on  Einstein  as  its  first
choice  and  forwarded  the  recommendation  to  the  education  ministry  in
Vienna. (Prague was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and such an
appointment  had  to  be  approved  by  Emperor  Franz  Joseph  and  his
ministers.)  The  report  was  accompanied  by 
the  highest  possible
recommendation  from  the  best  possible  authority,  Max  Planck.  Einstein�s
theory of relativity �probably exceeds in audacity everything that has been
achieved so far in speculative science,� Planck proclaimed. �This principle
has brought about a revolution in our physical picture of the world that can

be  compared  only  to  that  produced  by  Copernicus.�  In  a  comment  that
might  later  have  seemed  prescient  to  Einstein,  Planck  added,  �Non-
Euclidean geometry is child�s play by comparison.�11

Planck�s  imprimatur  should  have  been  enough.  But  it  wasn�t.  The
ministry  decided  that  it  preferred  the  second-place  candidate,  Gustav
Jaumann,  who  had  two  advantages:  he  was  Austrian,  and  he  was  not
Jewish. �I did not get the call to Prague,� Einstein lamented to a friend in
August. �I was  proposed  by  the  faculty,  but  because  of my  Semitic  origin
the ministry did not approve.�

Jaumann,  however,  soon  discovered  that  he  was  the  faculty�s  second
choice,  and  he  erupted.  �If  Einstein  has  been  proposed  as  the  first  choice
because  of  the  belief  that  he  has  greater  achievements  to  his  credit,�  he
declared, �then I will have nothing to do with a university that chases after
modernity  and  does  not  appreciate  merit.�  So  by  October  1910,  Einstein
could confidently declare that his own appointment was �almost certain.�

There was one final hurdle, also dealing with religion. Being a Jew was a
disadvantage;  being  a  nonbeliever  who  claimed  no  religion  was  a
disqualifier.  The  empire  required  that  all  of  its  servants,  including
professors,  be  a  member  of  some  religion.  On  his  official  forms,  Einstein
had written that he had none. �Einstein is as unpractical as a child in cases
like this,� Friedrich Adler�s wife noted.

As it turned out, Einstein�s desire for the job was greater than his ornery
impracticality.  He  agreed  to  write  �Mosaic�  as  his  faith,  and  he  also
accepted  Austro-Hungarian  citizenship,  with  the  proviso  that  he  was
allowed  to  remain  a  Swiss  citizen  as  well.  Along  with  the  German
citizenship that he had forsaken but that would soon be foisted back on him,
that meant he had held, off and on, three citizenships by the age of 32. In
January 1911, he was officially appointed to the post, with a pay twice what
he had been making before  his  recent raise. He  agreed  to  move  to  Prague
that March.12

Einstein  had  two  scientific  heroes  he  had  never  met�Ernst  Mach  and
Hendrik  Lorentz�and  he  was  able  to  visit  them  both  before  his  move  to
Prague. When he went to Vienna for his formal presentation to the ministers
there,  he  called  on  Mach,  who  lived  in  a  suburb  of  that  city.  The  aging
physicist  and  preacher  of  empiricism,  who  so  deeply  influenced  the
Olympia  Academy  and 
in  Einstein  a  skepticism  about
unobservable  concepts  such  as  absolute  time,  had  a  gnarly  beard  and

instilled 

gnarlier personality. �Please speak loudly to me,� he barked when Einstein
entered his  room.  �In addition  to  my  other unpleasant  characteristics  I  am
also almost stone deaf.�

Einstein wanted to convince Mach of the reality of atoms, which the old
man  had  long  rejected  as  being  imaginary  constructs  of  the  human  mind.
�Let us suppose that by assuming the existence of atoms in a gas we were
able to predict an observable property of this gas that could not be predicted
on  the  basis  of  non-atomistic  theory,�  Einstein  asked.  �Would  you  then
accept such a hypothesis?�

�If with the help of the atomic hypothesis one could actually establish a
connection  between  several  observable  properties  which  without  it  would
remain isolated, then I should say that this hypothesis was an �economical�
one,� Mach grudgingly replied.

It  was  not  a  full  acceptance,  but  it  was  enough  for  Einstein.  �For  the
moment  Einstein  was  satisfied,�  his  friend  Philipp  Frank  noted.
Nevertheless,  Einstein  began  edging  away  from  Mach�s  skepticism  about
any theories of reality not built on directly observable data. He developed,
said  Frank,  �a  certain  aversion  to  the  Machist  philosophy.�13  It  was  the
beginning of an important conversion.

Just before moving to Prague, Einstein went to the Dutch town of Leiden
to meet Lorentz. Mari  accompanied him, and they accepted an invitation to
stay with Lorentz and his wife. Einstein wrote that he was looking forward
to  having  a  conversation  on  �the  radiation  problem,�  adding,  �I  wish  to
assure you in advance that I am not the orthodox light-quantizer for whom
you take me.�14

Einstein had long idolized Lorentz from afar. Just before he went to visit,
he wrote a friend: �I admire this man like no other; I might say, I love him.�
The feeling  was  reinforced  when  they  finally met. They  stayed  up late  on
Saturday  night  discussing  such  issues  as  the  relationship  between
temperature and electrical conductivity.

Lorentz thought he had caught Einstein in a small mathematical mistake
in  one  of  his  papers  on  light  quanta,  but  in  fact,  as  Einstein  noted,  it  was
simply  �a  one-time  writing  error�  where  he  had  left  out  a  ���  that  was
included later in the paper.15 Both the hospitality and �scientific stimulus�
made  Einstein  effusive  in  his  next  letter.  �You  radiate  so  much  goodness
and  benevolence,�  he  wrote,  �that  the  troubling  conviction  that  I  did  not

deserve the great kindness and honors could not even enter my mind during
my stay at your house.�16

Lorentz became, in the words of Abraham Pais, �the one father figure in
Einstein�s  life.�  After  his  pleasant  visit  to  Lorentz�s  study  in  Leiden,  he
would  return  whenever  he  could  find  an  excuse.  The  atmosphere  of  such
meetings was captured by their colleague Paul Ehrenfest:

The  best  easy  chair  was  carefully  pushed  in  place  next  to  the  large
work table for his esteemed guest. A cigar was given to him, and then
Lorentz  quietly  began  to  formulate  questions  concerning  Einstein�s
theory  of  the  bending  of  light  in  a  gravitational  field  .  .  .  As  Lorentz
spoke on, Einstein began to puff less frequently on his cigar, and he sat
more intently in his armchair. And when Lorentz had finished, Einstein
bent over the slip of paper on which Lorentz had written mathematical
formulas. The cigar was out, and Einstein pensively twisted his finger
in a lock of hair over his right ear. Lorentz sat smiling at an Einstein
completely lost in meditation, exactly the way that a father looks at a
particularly  beloved  son�full  of  confidence  that  the  youngster  will
crack  the  nut  he  has  given  him,  but  eager  to  see  how.  Suddenly,
Einstein�s head sat up joyfully; he had it. Still a bit of give and take,
interrupting  one  another,  a  partial  disagreement,  very  quick
clarification and a complete mutual understanding, and then both men
with  beaming  eyes  skimming  over  the  shining  riches  of  the  new
theory.17

When Lorentz died in 1928, Einstein would say in his eulogy, �I stand at
the  grave  of the  greatest  and noblest  man  of our times.� And in  1953, for
the  celebration  of  the  hundredth  anniversary  of  Lorentz�s  birth,  Einstein
wrote an essay on his importance. �Whatever came from this supreme mind
was  as  lucid  and  beautiful  as  a  good  work  of  art,�  he  wrote.  �He  meant
more to me personally than anybody else I have met in my lifetime.�18

Mari  was unhappy about moving to Prague. �I am not going there gladly
and I expect very little pleasure,� she wrote a friend. But initially, until the
city�s  dirtiness  and  snobbishness  became  oppressive,  their  life  there  was
nice enough. They had electric lighting in their home for the first time, and
both  the  space  and  money  for  a  live-in  maid.  �The  people  are  haughty,

 
shabby-genteel, or subservient, depending on their lot in life,� Einstein said.
�Many of them possess a certain grace.�19

From Einstein�s office at the university he could look down on a beautiful
park with shady trees and manicured gardens. In the morning, it would be
filled  just  with  women,  and  in  the  afternoon  just  with  men.  Some  walked
alone  as  if  deep  in  thought,  Einstein  noticed,  while  others  clustered  in
groups  holding  animated  arguments.  Eventually,  Einstein  asked  what  the
park was. It belonged, he was told, to an insane asylum. When he showed
his friend Philipp Frank the view, Einstein commented ruefully, �Those are
the madmen who do not occupy themselves with the quantum theory.�20

The  Einsteins  became  acquainted  with  Bertha  Fanta,  a  delightfully
cultured  woman  who  hosted  at  her  home  a  literary  and  musical  salon  for
Prague�s Jewish intelligentsia. Einstein was the ideal catch: a rising scholar
who was willing, with equal gusto, to play the violin or discuss Hume and
Kant, depending on the spirit of the occasion. Other habitu�s included the
young writer Franz Kafka and his friend Max Brod.

In his book The Redemption of Tycho Brahe, Brod seemed to use (though
he sometimes denied it) Einstein as the model for the character of Johannes
Kepler, the brilliant astronomer who had been Brahe�s assistant in Prague in
1600. The character is devoted to his scientific work and is always willing
to throw away conventional thinking. But in the realm of the personal, he is
protected from �the aberrations of feeling� by his aloof and abstracted air.
�He had no heart and therefore nothing to fear from the world,� Brod wrote.
�He  was  not  capable  of  emotion  or  love.�  When  the  novel  came  out,  a
fellow  scientist,  Walther  Nernst,  said  to  Einstein,  �You  are  this  man
Kepler.�21

Not  really.  Despite  the  image  he  sometimes  cast  as  a  loner,  Einstein
continued  to  establish,  as  he  had  back  in  Zurich  and  Bern,  intimate
friendships  and  emotional  bonds,  particularly  with  fellow  thinkers  and
scientists.  One  such  friend  was  Paul  Ehrenfest,  a  young  Jewish  physicist
from  Vienna  who  was  teaching  at  the  University  of  St.  Petersburg  but
feeling  professionally  stymied  there  because  of  his  background.  In  early
1912, he embarked on a trip through Europe looking for a new job, and on
his  way  toward  Prague  contacted  Einstein,  with  whom  he  had  been
corresponding about gravity and radiation. �Do stay at my house so that we
can make good use of the time,� Einstein responded.22

When Ehrenfest arrived one rainy Friday afternoon in February, a cigar-
puffing Einstein and his wife were at the train station to meet him. They all
walked  to  a  caf�,  where  they  compared  the  great  cities  of  Europe.  When
Mari   left,  the  discussion  turned  to  science,  most  notably  statistical
mechanics, and they continued talking as they walked to Einstein�s office.
�On  the  way  to  the  institute,  first  argument  about  everything,�  Ehrenfest
recorded in his diary of the seven days he spent in Prague.

Ehrenfest  was  a  mousy  and  insecure  man,  but  his  eagerness  for
friendship and his love of physics made it easy for him to forge a bond with
Einstein.23 They both seemed to crave arguing about science, and Einstein
later said that �within a few hours we were friends as if Nature created us
for each other.�Their intense discussions continued the next day, as Einstein
explained  his  efforts  to  generalize  his  theory  of  relativity.  On  Sunday
evening, they relaxed a bit by performing Brahms, with Ehrenfest on piano,
Einstein  on  violin,  and  7-year-old  Hans  Albert  singing.  �Yes  we  will  be
friends,� Ehrenfest wrote in his diary that night. �Was awfully happy.�24

Einstein  was  already  thinking  of  leaving  Prague,  and  he  suggested
Ehrenfest as a possible successor. But he �adamantly refuses to profess any
religious  affiliation,�  Einstein  lamented.  Unlike  Einstein,  who  was  willing
to relent and write �Mosaic� on his official forms, Ehrenfest had abandoned
Judaism  and  would  not  profess  otherwise.  �Your  stubborn  refusal  to
acknowledge  any religious affiliation  really bugs  me,�  Einstein  wrote  him
in  April.  �Drop  it  for  your  children�s  sake.  After  all,  after  becoming  a
professor here you could revert to this strange hobby horse of yours.�25

Matters eventually came to a happy resolution when Ehrenfest accepted
an  offer,  which  Einstein  had  earlier  received  but  declined,  to  replace  the
revered  Lorentz,  who  was  cutting  back  from  full-time  teaching  at  the
University of Leiden. Einstein was thrilled, for it meant he would now have
two friends there to visit regularly. It became, for Einstein, almost a second
academic  home  and  a  way  to  escape  the  oppressive  atmosphere  he  later
found  in  Berlin.  Almost  every  year  for  the  next  two  decades,  until  1933
when  Ehrenfest  committed  suicide  and  Einstein  moved  to  America,
Einstein would make regular pilgrimages to see him and Lorentz in Leiden
or at the seaside resorts nearby.26

The 1911 Solvay Conference

Ernest  Solvay  was  a  Belgian  chemist  and  industrialist  who  reaped  a
fortune by inventing  a method for  making soda. Because he wanted to  do
something unusual yet useful with his money, and also because he had some
odd theories of gravity that he wanted scientists to listen to, he decided to
fund an elite gathering of Europe�s top physicists. Scheduled for the end of
October 1911, it eventually spawned a series of influential meetings, known
as Solvay Conferences, that were held sporadically over the ensuing years.

Twenty of Europe�s most famous scientists showed up at the Grand Hotel
Metropole  in  Brussels.  At  32,  Einstein  was  the  youngest.  There  was  Max
Planck,  Henri  Poincar�,  Marie  Curie,  Ernest  Rutherford,  and  Wilhelm
Wien.  The  chemist  Walther  Nernst  organized  the  event  and  acted  as
chaperone for the quirky Ernest Solvay. The kindly Hendrik Lorentz served
as  the  chairman,  as  his  fan  Einstein  put  it,  �with  incomparable  tact  and
unbelievable virtuosity.�27

The  focus  of  the  conference  was  �the  quantum  problem,�  and  Einstein
was  asked  to  present  a  paper  on  that  topic,  making  him  one  of  only  eight
�particularly  competent  members�  thus  honored.  He  expressed  some
annoyance,  perhaps  a  bit  more  feigned  than  real,  about  the  prestigious
assignment.  He  dubbed  the  upcoming  meeting  �the  witch�s  Sabbath�  and
complained  to  Besso,  �My  twaddle  for  the  Brussels  conference  weighs
down on me.�28

Einstein�s  talk  was  titled  �The  Present  State  of  the  Problem  of  Specific
Heats.�  Specific  heat�the  quantity  of  energy  required  to  increase  the
temperature  of  a  specific  amount  of  substance  by  a  certain  amount�had
been a specialty of Einstein�s former professor and antagonist at the Zurich
Polytechnic,  Heinrich  Weber.  Weber  had  discovered  some  anomalies,
especially  at  low  temperatures,  in  the  laws  that  were  supposed  to  govern
specific  heat.  Beginning  in  late  1906,  Einstein  had  come  up  with  what  he
called a �quantized� approach to the problem by surmising that the atoms in
each substance could absorb energy only in discrete packets.

In  his  1911  Solvay  lecture,  Einstein  put  these  issues  into  the  larger
context  of  the  so-called  quantum  problem.  Was  it  possible,  he  asked,  to
avoid  accepting  the  physical  reality  of  these  atomistic  particles  of  light,
which  were  like  bullets  aimed  at  the  heart  of  Maxwell�s  equations  and,
indeed, all of classical physics?

 
Planck, who had pioneered the concept of the quanta, continued to insist
that  they  came  into  play  only  when  light  was  being  emitted  or  absorbed.
They were not a real-world feature of light itself, he argued. Einstein, in his
talk to the conference, sorrowfully demurred: �These discontinuities, which
we find so distasteful in Planck�s theory, seem really to exist in nature.�29

Really  to  exist  in  nature.  It  was,  for  Einstein,  an  odd  phrase.  To  a  pure
proponent of Mach, or for that matter of Hume, the whole phrase �really to
exist  in  nature�  lacked  clear  meaning.  In  his  special  relativity  theory,
Einstein had avoided assuming the existence of such things as absolute time
and  absolute  distance,  because  it  seemed  meaningless  to  say  that  they
�really� existed in nature when they couldn�t be observed. But henceforth,
during  the  more  than  four  decades  in  which  he  would  express  his
discomfort  with  quantum  theory,  he  increasingly  sounded  like  a  scientific
realist,  someone  who  believed  that  an  underlying  reality  existed  in  nature
that was independent of our ability to observe or measure it.

When  he  was  finished,  Einstein  faced  a  barrage  of  challenges  from
Lorentz, Planck, Poincar�, and others. Some of what Einstein said, Lorentz
rose to point out,�seems in fact to be totally incompatible with Maxwell�s
equations.�

Einstein  agreed,  perhaps  too  readily,  that  �the  quantum  hypothesis  is
provisional� and that it �does not seem compatible with the experimentally
verified  conclusions  of  the  wave  theory.�  Somehow  it  was  necessary,  he
told his questioners, to accommodate both wave and particle approaches to
the  understanding  of  light.  �In  addition  to  Maxwell�s  electrodynamics,
which  is  essential  to  us,  we  must  also  admit  a  hypothesis  such  as  that  of
quanta.�30

It  was  unclear,  even  to  Einstein,  whether  Planck  was  persuaded  of  the
reality  of  quanta.  �I  largely  succeeded  in  convincing  Planck  that  my
conception is correct, after he has struggled against it for so many years,�
Einstein wrote his friend Heinrich Zangger. But a week later, Einstein gave
Zangger  another  report:  �Planck  stuck  stubbornly  to  some  undoubtedly
wrong preconceptions.�

As for Lorentz, Einstein remained as admiring as ever: �A living work of
art! He was in my opinion the most intelligent of the theoreticians present.�
He  dismissed  Poincar�,  who  paid  little  attention  to  him,  with  a  brusque
stroke:  �Poincar�  was  simply  negative  in  general,  and,  all  his  acumen
notwithstanding, he showed little grasp of the situation.�31

Overall he gave low marks to the conference, where most of the time was
spent  bewailing  rather  than  resolving  quantum  theory�s  threat  to  classical
mechanics.  �The  congress  in  Brussels  resembled  the  lamentations  on  the
ruins  of  Jerusalem,�  he  wrote  Besso.  �Nothing  positive  has  come  out  of
it.�32

There  was  one  interesting  sideshow  for  Einstein:  the  romance  between
the  widowed  Marie  Curie  and  the  married  Paul  Langevin.  Dignified  and
dedicated,  Madame  Curie  was  the  first  woman  to  win  a  Nobel  Prize;  she
shared the 1903 physics prize with her husband and one other scientist for
their  work  on  radiation.  Three  years  later,  her  husband  was  killed  by  a
horse-drawn wagon. She was bereft, and so was her late husband�s prot�g�,
Langevin,  who  taught  physics  at  the  Sorbonne  with  the  Curies.  Langevin
was trapped in a marriage with a wife who physically abused him, and soon
he and Marie Curie were having an affair in a Paris apartment. His wife had
someone break into it and steal their love letters.

Just  as  the  Solvay  Conference  was  getting  under  way,  with  both  Curie
and Langevin in attendance, the purloined letters began appearing in a Paris
tabloid as a prelude to a sensational divorce case. In addition, at that very
moment, it was announced that Curie had won the Nobel Prize in chemistry,
for discovering radium and polonium.* A member of the Swedish Academy
wrote her to suggest that she not appear to receive it, given the furor raised
by  her  relationship  with  Langevin,  but  she  coolly  responded,  �I  believe
there is no connection between my scientific work and the facts of private
life.� She headed to Stockholm and accepted the prize.33

The  whole  furor  seemed  silly  to  Einstein.  �She  is  an  unpretentious,
honest  person,�  he  said,  with  �a  sparkling  intelligence.�  He  also  rather
bluntly came to the conclusion, not justified, that she was not pretty enough
to wreck anyone�s marriage. �Despite her passionate nature,� he said, �she
is not attractive enough to represent a danger to anyone.�34

More  gracious  was  the  sturdy  letter  of  support  he  sent  her  later  that

month:

Do not laugh at me for writing you without having anything sensible to
say.  But  I  am  so  enraged  by  the  base  manner  in  which  the  public  is
presently daring to concern itself with you that I absolutely must give
vent to this feeling. I am impelled to tell you how much I have come to
admire your intellect, your drive, and your honesty, and that I consider

myself  lucky  to  have  made  your  personal  acquaintance  in  Brussels.
Anyone who does not number among these reptiles is certainly happy,
now  as  before,  that  we  have  such  personages  among  us  as  you,  and
Langevin  too,  real  people  with  whom  one  feels  privileged  to  be  in
contact. If the rabble continues to occupy itself with you, then simply
don�t read that hogwash, but rather leave it to the reptile for whom it
has been fabricated.35

Enter Elsa

As Einstein wandered around Europe giving speeches and basking in his
rising  renown,  his  wife  stayed  behind  in  Prague,  a  city  she  hated,  and
brooded about not being part of the scientific circles that she once struggled
to  join.  �I  would  like  to  have  been  there  and  listened  a  little,  and  seen  all
these fine people,� she wrote him after one of his talks in October 1911. �It
is so long since we saw each other that I wonder if you will recognize me.�
She  signed  herself,  �Deine  alte  D,�  your  old  D,  as  if  she  were  still  his
Dollie, albeit a bit older.36

Her circumstances, perhaps combined with an innate disposition, caused
her  to  become  gloomy,  even  depressed.  When  Philipp  Frank  met  her  in
Prague  for  the  first  time,  he  thought  that  she  might  be  schizophrenic.
Einstein  concurred,  and  he  later  told  a  colleague  that  her  gloominess  �is
doubtless traceable to a schizophrenic genetic disposition coming from her
mother�s family.�37

Thus it was that Einstein�s marriage was once again in an unstable state
when he traveled alone to Berlin during the Easter holidays in 1912. There
he  became  reacquainted  with  a  cousin,  three  years  older,  whom  he  had
known as a child.

Elsa  Einstein*  was  the  daughter  of  Rudolf  (�the  rich�)  Einstein  and
Fanny Koch  Einstein.  She was  Einstein�s cousin  on both  sides.  Her  father
was the first cousin of Einstein�s father, Hermann, and had helped fund his
business. Her  mother  was  the  sister  of Einstein�s mother,  Pauline (making
Elsa and Albert first cousins). After Hermann�s death, Pauline had moved in
with Rudolf and Fanny Einstein for a few years, helping them keep house.

 
 
As children, Albert and Elsa had played together at the home of Albert�s
parents in Munich and on one occasion had shared a first artistic experience
at the opera.38 Since then, Elsa had been married, divorced, and now, at age
36,  was  living  with  her  two  daughters,  Margot  and  Ilse,  in  the  same
apartment building as her parents.

The  contrast  with  Einstein�s  wife  was  stark.  Mileva  Mari   was  exotic,
intellectual,  and  complex.  Elsa  wasn�t.  Instead,  she  was  conventionally
handsome  and  domestically  nurturing.  She  loved  heavy  German  comfort
foods  and  chocolate,  which  tended  to  give  her  a  rather  ample,  matronly
look. Her face was similar to her cousin�s, and it would become strikingly
more so as they aged.39

Einstein  was  looking  for  new  companionship,  and  he  first  flirted  with
Elsa�s  sister.  But  by  the  end  of  his  Easter  visit,  he  had  settled  on  Elsa  as
offering  the  comfort  and  nurturing  that  he  now  craved.  The  love  he  was
seeking,  it  seems,  was  not  wild  romance  but  uncomplicated  support  and
affection.

And Elsa, who revered her cousin, was eager to give it. When he returned
to  Prague,  she  wrote  him  right  away�sending  the  letter  to  his  office,  not
his home, and proposing a way they could correspond in secret. �How dear
of  you  not  to  be  too  proud  to  communicate  with  me  in  such  a  way!�  he
responded. �I can�t even begin to tell you how fond I have become of you
during these few days.� She asked him to destroy her letters, which he did.
She, on the other hand, kept his responses for the rest of her life in a folder
that  she  tied  and  later  labeled  �Especially  beautiful  letters  from  better
days.�40

Einstein apologized for his flirtation with her sister Paula.�It is hard for
me to understand how I could have taken a fancy to her,� he declared. �But
it is in fact simple. She was young, a girl, and complaisant.�

A  decade  earlier,  when  he  was  writing  his  love  letters  to  Mari   that
celebrated their own rarefied and bohemian approach to life, Einstein would
likely  have  lumped  relatives  such  as  Elsa  into  the  category  of  �bourgeois
philistines.� But now, in letters that were almost as effusive as the ones he
had written to Mari , he professed his new passion for Elsa. �I have to have
someone to love, otherwise life is miserable,� he wrote. �And this someone
is you.�

She  knew  how  to  make  him  defensive:  she  teased  him  for  being  under
Mari �s  thumb  and  asserted  that  he  was  �henpecked.�  As  she  may  have
hoped, Einstein responded by protesting that he would show her otherwise.
�Do not think about me in such a way!� he said. �I categorically assure you
that I consider myself a full-fledged male. Perhaps I will sometime have the
opportunity to prove it to you.�

Spurred  by  this  new  affection  and  by  the  prospect  of  working  in  the
world�s capital of theoretical physics, Einstein developed a desire to move
to Berlin. �The chances of getting a call to Berlin are, unfortunately, slight,�
he admitted to Elsa. But on his visit, he did what he could to increase his
chances  of  someday  getting  a  position  there.  In  his  notebook  he  listed
appointments  he  had  been  able  to  get  with  important  academic  leaders,
including the scientists Fritz Haber, Walther Nernst, and Emil Warburg.41

Einstein�s son Hans Albert later recalled that it was just after his eighth
birthday, in the spring of 1912, when he noticed that his parents� marriage
was  falling  apart.  But  after  returning  to  Prague  from  Berlin,  Einstein
seemed to develop qualms about his affair with his cousin. He tried, in two
letters, to put an end to it. �There would only be confusion and misfortune
if we were to give into our mutual attraction,� he wrote Elsa.

Later that month, he tried to be even more definitive. �It will not be good
for the two of us, as well as for the others, if we form a closer attachment.
So, I am writing to you today for the last time and am submitting again to
the inevitable, and you must do the same. You know that it is not hardness
of heart or lack of feeling that makes me talk like this, because you know
that, like you, I bear my cross without hope.�42

Einstein  and  Mari   shared  one  thing:  a  feeling  that  living  among  the
middle-class German community in Prague had become wearisome. �These
are  not  people  with  natural  sentiments,�  he  told  Besso.  They  displayed  �a
peculiar  mixture  of  snobbery  and  servility,  without  any  kind  of  goodwill
toward their  fellow men.�  The  water  was  un-drinkable,  the  air was  full  of
soot, and an ostentatious luxury was juxtaposed with misery on the streets.
But what offended Einstein most were the artificial class structures. �When
I  come  to  the  institute,�  he  complained,  �a  servile  man  who  smells  of
alcohol bows and says, �your most humble servant.� �43

Mari  worried that the bad water, milk, and air were hurting the health of
their  younger  son,  Eduard.  He  had  lost  his  appetite  and  was  not  sleeping
well. It was also now clear that her husband cared more about his science

than his family. �He is tirelessly working on his problems; one can say that
he lives  only  for  them,�  she told her friend Helene Savi .  �I must confess
with  a  bit  of  shame  that  we  are  unimportant  to  him  and  take  second
place.�44

So Einstein and his wife decided to return to the one place they thought

could restore their relationship.

Zurich, 1912

The Zurich Polytechnic, where Einstein and Mari   had blissfully  shared
their  books  and  their  souls,  had  been  upgraded  in  June  1911  to  a  full
university,  now  named  the  Eidgen�ssische  Technische  Hochschule  (ETH),
or  the  Swiss  Federal  Institute  of  Technology,  with  the  right  to  grant
graduate degrees. At 32 and by now quite famous in the world of theoretical
physics, Einstein should have been an easy and obvious choice for one of
the new professorships available there.

That  possibility  had  been  discussed  a  year  earlier.  Before  he  left  for
Prague,  Einstein  had  made  a  deal  with  officials  in  Zurich.  �I  promised  in
private  that  I  would  advise  them  before  accepting  another  offer  from
somewhere  else,  so  that  the  administration  of  the  Polytechnic  could  also
make me an offer if they find it fit to do so,� he told a Dutch professor who
was trying to recruit him to Utrecht.45

By November 1911, Einstein had received such an offer from Zurich, or
at least so he thought, and as a result he declined the offer to go to Utrecht.
But  the  matter  was  not  completely  settled,  because  some  of  Zurich�s
education  officials  objected.  They  argued  that  a  professor  in  theoretical
physics  was  a  �luxury,�  that  there  was  not  enough  lab  space  to
accommodate one, and that Einstein personally was not a good teacher.

Heinrich  Zangger,  a  longtime  friend  who  was  a  medical  researcher  in
Zurich, intervened on Einstein�s behalf. �A proper theoretical physicist is a
necessity  these  days,�  he  wrote  in  a  letter  to  one  of  the  top  Swiss
councilors.  He  also  pointed  out  that  in  such  a  role  Einstein  �needs  no
laboratory.�  As  for  Einstein�s  teaching  talents,  Zangger  provided  a
wonderfully nuanced and revealing description:

 
He is not a good teacher for mentally lazy gentlemen who merely want
to  fill  a  notebook  and  then  learn  it  by  heart  for  an  exam;  he  is  not  a
smooth talker, but anyone wishing to learn honestly how to develop his
ideas  in  physics  in  an  honest  way,  from  deep  within,  and  how  to
examine all premises carefully and see the pitfalls and the problems in
his  reflections,  will  find  Einstein  a  first-class  teacher,  because  all  of
this  is  expressed  in  his  lectures,  which  force  the  audience  to  think
along.46

Zangger wrote Einstein to express his outrage at the dithering in Zurich,
and Einstein replied, �The dear Zurich folks can kiss my . . . [und die lieben
Z�richer  k�nnen  mich  auch  .  .  .  (ellipses  are  in  original  letter)].�  He  told
Zangger  not  to  push  the  matter  further.  �Leave  the  Polytechnic*  to  God�s
inscrutable ways.�47

Einstein, however, decided not to drop the matter but instead to push the
Polytechnic through a light ruse. Officials at the university in Utrecht were
just  about  to  offer  their  open  post  to  someone  else,  Peter  Debye,  when
Einstein  asked  them  to  hold  off.  �I  am  turning  to  you  with  a  strange
request,� he wrote. The Zurich Polytechnic had initially seemed very eager
to recruit him, he said, and it had been proceeding with haste out of fear that
he  would  go  to  Utrecht.  �But  if  they  were  to  learn  in  the  near  future  that
Debye is going to Utrecht, they would lose their fervor at once and keep me
forever  in  suspense.  I  ask  you  therefore  to  wait  a  little  longer  with  the
official offer to Debye.�48

Rather oddly, Einstein found himself needing letters of recommendation
to secure a post at his own alma mater. Marie Curie wrote one. �In Brussels,
where  I  attended  a  scientific  conference  in  which  Mr.  Einstein  also
participated, I was able to admire the clarity of his intellect, the breadth of
his information, and the profundity of his knowledge,� she noted.49

Adding  to  the  irony  was  that  his  other  main  letter  of  recommendation
came  from  Henri  Poincar�,  the  man  who  had  almost  come  up  with  the
special theory of relativity but still had not embraced it. Einstein was �one
of the  most original minds I  have ever  come  across,�  he said.  Particularly
poignant  was  his  description  of  Einstein�s  willingness,  which  Poincar�
himself lacked, to make radical conceptual leaps: �What I admire in him in
particular is the facility with which he adapts himself to new concepts. He
does not remain attached to classical principles, and, when presented with a

 
problem  in  physics,  is  prompt  to  envision  all  the  possibilities.�  Poincar�,
however,  could  not  resist  asserting,  perhaps  with  relativity  in  mind,  that
Einstein  might  not  be  right  in  all  his  theories:  �Since  he  seeks  in  all
directions one must expect the majority of the paths on which he embarks to
be blind alleys.�50

Soon it all worked out. Einstein would move back to Zurich in July 1912.
He  thanked  Zangger  for  helping  him  to  prevail  �against  all  odds,�  and
exulted, �I am enormously happy that we will be together again.� Mari  was
thrilled as well. She thought that the return could help save both her sanity
and their marriage. Even the children seemed happy to be out of Prague and
back  to  the  city  of  their  birth.  As  Einstein  put  it  in  a  postcard  to  another
friend,�Great joy about it among us old folks and the two bear cubs.�51

His departure caused a minor controversy in Prague. Newspaper articles
noted that anti-Semitism at the university may have played a role. Einstein
felt  compelled  to  issue  a  public  statement.  �Despite  all  presumptions,�  he
said,�I  did  not  feel  and  did  not  notice  any  religious  prejudice.�  The
appointment of Philipp Frank, a Jew, as his successor, he added, confirmed
that �such considerations�were not a major problem.52

Life  in  Zurich  should  have  been  glorious.  The  Einsteins  were  able  to
afford a modern six-room apartment with grand views. They were reunited
with friends such as Zangger and Grossmann, and there was even one fewer
adversary.  �The  fierce  Weber  has  died,  so  it  will  be  very  pleasant  from  a
personal  point  of  view,�  Einstein  wrote  of  their  undergraduate  physics
professor and nemesis, Heinrich Weber.53

Once again there were musical gatherings at the home of math professor
Adolf Hurwitz. The programs included not only Mozart, Einstein�s favorite,
but  also  Schumann,  who  was  Mari �s.  On  Sunday  afternoons,  Einstein
would arrive with his wife and two little boys at the doorstep and announce,
�Here comes the whole Einstein hen house.�

Despite being back with such friends and diversions, Mari �s depression
continued to deepen, and her health to decline. She developed rheumatism,
which made it hard for her to go out, especially when the streets became icy
in  winter.  She  attended  the  Hurwitz  recitals  less  frequently,  and  when  she
did  show  up  her  gloom  was  increasingly  evident.  In  February  1913,  to
entice  her  out,  the  Hurwitz  family  planned  an  all-Schumann  recital.  She
came, but seemed paralyzed by pain, both mental and physical.54

Thus  the  atmosphere  was  ripe  for  a  catalyst  that  would  disrupt  this
unstable family situation. It came in the form of a letter. After almost a year
of silence, Elsa Einstein wrote to her cousin.

The previous May, when he had declared that he was writing her �for the
last time,� Einstein had nonetheless given her the address of what would be
his new office in Zurich. Now Elsa decided to send him a greeting for his
thirty-fourth  birthday,  and  she  added  a  request  for  a  picture  of  him  and  a
recommendation of a good book she could read on relativity. She knew how
to flatter.55

�There is no book on relativity that is comprehensible to the layman,� he
replied. �But what do you have a relativity cousin for? If you ever happen
to  be  in  Zurich,  then  we  (without  my  wife,  who  is  unfortunately  very
jealous) will take a nice walk, and I will tell you about all of those curious
things that I  discovered.�  Then he went a bit further.  Instead of sending  a
picture,  wouldn�t  it  be  better  to  see  each  other  in  person?  �If  you  wish  to
make me truly happy, then arrange to spend a few days here sometime.�56

A  few  days  later,  he  wrote  again,  with  word  that  he  had  instructed  a
photographer  to  send  her  a  picture.  He  had  been  working  on  generalizing
his theory of relativity, he reported, and it was exhausting. As he had a year
earlier, he complained about being married to Mari : �What I wouldn�t give
to be able to spend a few days with you, but without my cross!� He asked
Elsa if she would be in Berlin later that summer. �I would like to come for a
short visit.�57

It  was  therefore  not  surprising  that  Einstein  was  very  receptive,  a  few
months  later,  when  the  two  towers  of  Berlin�s  scientific  establishment�
Max Planck and Walther Nernst�came to Zurich with an enticing proposal.
Having been impressed by Einstein at the Solvay Conference of 1911, they
had already been sounding out colleagues about getting him to Berlin.

The offer they brought with them, when they arrived with their wives on
the  night  train  from  Berlin  on  July  11,  1913,  had  three  impressive
components: Einstein would be elected to a coveted vacancy in the Prussian
Academy  of  Sciences,  which  would  come  with  a  hefty  stipend;  he  would
become  the  director  of  a  new  physics  institute;  and  he  would  be  made  a
professor at the University of Berlin. The package included a lot of money,
and it was not nearly as much work as it may have seemed on the surface.
Planck  and  Nernst  made  it  clear  that  Einstein  would  have  no  required
teaching  duties  at  the  university  and  no  real  administrative  tasks  at  the

institute.  And  though  he  would  be  required  to  accept  German  citizenship
once again, he could keep his Swiss citizenship as well.

The visitors made their case during a long visit to Einstein�s sunny office
at the Polytechnic. He said he needed a few hours to think it over, though it
is likely he knew he would accept. So Planck and Nernst took their wives
on an excursion by funicular railway up one of the nearby mountains. With
puckish amusement, Einstein told them he would be awaiting their return to
the station with a signal. If he had decided to decline, he would be carrying
a white rose, and if he was going to accept, a red rose (some accounts have
the  signal  being  a  white  handkerchief).  When  they  stepped  off  the  train,
they happily discovered that he had accepted.58

That meant that Einstein would become, at 34, the youngest member of
the Prussian Academy. But first Planck had to get him elected. The letter he
wrote, which was also signed by Nernst and others, had the memorable but
incorrect  concession,  quoted  earlier,  that  �he  might  sometimes  have
overshot the target in his speculations, as for example in his light quantum
hypothesis.� But the rest of the letter was suffused with extravagant praise
for  each  of  his  many  scientific  contributions.  �Among  the  great  problems
abundant in modern physics, there is hardly one to which Einstein has not
made a remarkable contribution.�59

The  Berliners  were  taking  a  risk,  Einstein  realized.  He  was  being
recruited not  for  his  teaching  skills (as  he would  not  be teaching),  nor for
his  administrative  ones. And even though  he had been publishing  outlines
and  papers  describing  his  ongoing  efforts  to  generalize  relativity,  it  was
unclear  whether  he  would  succeed  in  that  quest.  �The  Germans  are
gambling on me as they would on a prize-winning hen,� he told a friend as
they were leaving a party, �but I don�t know if I can still lay eggs.�60

Einstein, likewise, was taking a risk. He had a secure and lucrative post
in  a  city  and  society  that  he,  his  wife,  and  his  family  loved.  The  Swiss
personality agreed with him. His wife had a Slav�s revulsion for all things
Teutonic,  and  he  had  a  similar  distaste  that  had  been  in-grained  in
childhood. As a boy he had run away from Prussian-accented parades and
Germanic  rigidity.  Only  the  opportunity  to  be  gloriously  coddled  in  the
world capital of science could have compelled him to make such a move.

Einstein  found  the  prospect  thrilling  and  a  bit  amusing.  �I  am  going  to
Berlin  as  an  Academy-man  without  any  obligations,  rather  like  a  living
mummy,�  he  wrote  fellow  physicist  Jakob  Laub.  �I�m  already  looking

forward  to  this  difficult  career!�61  To  Ehrenfest  he  admitted,  �I  accepted
this odd sinecure because giving lectures gets on my nerves.�62 However, to
the venerable Hendrik Lorentz in Holland Einstein displayed more gravitas:
�I could not resist the temptation to accept a position in which I am relieved
of  all  responsibilities  so  that  I  can  give  myself  over  completely  to
rumination.�63

There was, of course, another factor that made the new job enticing: the
chance to be with his cousin and new love, Elsa. As he would later admit to
his friend Zangger, �She was the main reason for my going to Berlin, you
know.�64

The same evening that Planck and Nernst left Zurich, Einstein wrote Elsa
an  excited  letter  describing  the  �colossal  honor�  they  had  offered.  �Next
spring  at  the  latest,  I�ll  come  to  Berlin  for  good,�  he  exulted.  �I  already
rejoice at the wonderful times we will spend together!�

During the ensuing week, he sent two more such notes. �I rejoice at the
thought that I will soon be coming to you,� he wrote in the first. And a few
days  later:  �Now  we  will  be  together  and  rejoice  in  each  other!�  It  is
impossible  to  know  for  sure  what  relative  weight  to  assign  to  each  of  the
factors enticing him to Berlin: the unsurpassed scientific community there,
the  glories  and  perks  of  the  post  he  was  offered,  or  the  chance  to  be  with
Elsa.  But  at  least  to  her  he  claimed  it  was  primarily  the  latter.  �I  look
forward keenly to Berlin, mainly because I look forward to you.�65

Elsa had actually tried to help him get the offer. Earlier in the year, on her
own  initiative,  she  had  dropped  in  on  Fritz  Haber,  who  ran  the  Kaiser
Wilhelm Institute of Chemistry in Berlin, and let him know that her cousin
might  be  open  to  a  position  that  would  bring  him  to  Berlin.  When  he
learned of Elsa�s intervention, Einstein was amused. �Haber knows who he
is  dealing  with.  He  knows  how  to  appreciate  the  influence  of  a  friendly
female cousin . . . The nonchalance with which you dropped in on Haber is
pure Elsa. Did you tell anyone about it, or did you consult only with your
wicked heart? If only I could have looked on!�66

Even before Einstein moved to Berlin, he and Elsa began to correspond
as if they were a couple. She worried about his exhaustion and sent him a
long  letter  prescribing  more  exercise,  rest,  and  a  healthier  diet.  He
responded by saying that he planned to �smoke like a chimney, work like a
horse, eat without thinking, go for a walk only in really pleasant company.�

He made clear, however, that she should not expect him to abandon his
wife: �You and I can very well be happy with each other without her having
to be hurt.�67

Indeed, even amid his flurry of love letters with Elsa, Einstein was still
trying  to  be  a  suitable  family  man.  For  his  August  1913  vacation,  he
decided to take his wife and two sons hiking with Marie Curie and her two
daughters.  The  plan  was  to  go  through  the  mountains  of  southeastern
Switzerland down to Lake Como, where he and Mari  had spent their most
passionate and romantic moments twelve years earlier.

As it turned out, the sickly Eduard was unable to make the trip, and Mari
stayed  behind  for  a  few  days  to  get  him  settled  with  friends.  Then  she
joined them as they neared Lake Como. During the hikes, Curie challenged
Einstein  to  name  all  the  peaks.  They  also  talked  science,  especially  when
the children ran ahead. At one point Einstein stopped suddenly and grabbed
Curie�s arm. �You understand, what I need to know is exactly what happens
to  the  passengers  in  an  elevator  when  it  falls  into  emptiness,�  he  said,
referring to his ideas about the equivalence of gravity and acceleration. As
Curie�s  daughter  noted  later,  �Such  a  touching  preoccupation  made  the
younger generation roar with laughter.�68

Einstein then accompanied Mari  and their children to visit her family in
Novi  Sad  and  at  their  summer  house  in  Ka .  On  their  final  Sunday  in
Serbia, Mari  took the children, without her husband, to be baptized. Hans
Albert remembered later the beautiful singing; his brother, Eduard, only 3,
was  disruptive.  As  for  their  father,  he  seemed  sanguine  and  bemused
afterward.  �Do  you  know  what  the  result  is?�  he  told  Hurwitz.�They�ve
turned Catholic. Well, it�s all the same to me.�69

The fa�ade of familial harmony, however, masked the deterioration of the
marriage.  After  his  visit  to  Serbia  and  a  stop  in  Vienna  for  his  annual
appearance  at  the  conference  of  German-speaking  physicists,  Einstein
continued on to Berlin, alone. There he was reunited with Elsa. �I now have
someone  I  can  think  about  with  pure  delight  and  I  can  live  for,�  he  told
her.70

Elsa�s  home  cooking,  a  hearty  pleasure  she  lavished  on  him  like  a
mother,  became  a  theme  in  their  letters.  Their  correspondence,  like  their
relationship, was a stark contrast to that between Einstein and Mari  a dozen
years  earlier.  He  and  Elsa  tended  to  write  to  each  other  about  domestic
comforts�food, 
than  about
romantic bliss and planted kisses, or intimacies of the soul and insights of
the intellect.

tranquillity,  hygiene, 

fondness�rather 

Despite  such  conventional  concerns,  Einstein  still  fancied 

their
relationship  could  avoid  sinking  into  a  mundane  pattern.  �How  nice  it
would be if one of these days we could share in managing a small bohemian
household,�  he  wrote.  �You  have  no  idea  how  charming  such  a  life  with
very  small  needs  and  without  grandeur  can  be!�71  When  Elsa  gave  him  a
hairbrush, he initially prided himself on his progress in personal grooming,
but then he reverted to more slovenly ways and told her, only half jokingly,
that it was to guard against the philistines and the bourgeoisie. Those were
words he had used with Mari  as well, but more earnestly.

Elsa  wanted  not  only  to  domesticate  Einstein  but  to  marry  him.  Even
before he moved to Berlin, she wrote to urge him to divorce Mari . It would
become a running battle for years, until she finally won her way. But for the
moment, Einstein was resistant. �Do you think,� he asked her, �it is so easy
to get a divorce if one does not have any proof of the other party�s guilt?�
She should accept that he had virtually separated from Mari  even if he was
not  going  to  divorce  her.  �I  treat  my  wife  as  an  employee  whom  I  cannot
fire.  I  have  my  own  bedroom  and  avoid  being  alone  with  her.�  Elsa  was
upset that Einstein did not want to marry her, and she was fearful of how an
illicit  relationship  would  affect  her  daughters,  but  Einstein  insisted  it  was
for the best.72

Mari  was understandably depressed by the prospect of moving to Berlin.
There she would have to deal with Einstein�s mother, who had never liked
her,  and  his  cousin,  whom  she  rightly  suspected  of  being  a  rival.  In
addition, Berlin had sometimes been less tolerant to Slavs than it was even
to Jews. �My wife whines to me incessantly about Berlin and her fear of the
relatives,�  Einstein  wrote  Elsa.  �Well,  there  is  some  truth  in  this.�  In
another  letter,  when  he  noted  that  Mari   was  afraid  of  her,  he  added,
�Rightly so I hope!�73

Indeed,  by  this  point  all  of  the  women  in  his  life�his  mother,  sister,
wife, and kissing cousin�were at war with one another. As Christmas 1913

neared, Einstein�s struggle to generalize relativity had the added benefit of
being  a  way  to  avoid  family  emotions.  The  effort  produced  yet  another
eloquent  restatement  of  how  science  could  rescue  him  from  the  merely
personal. �The love of science thrives under these circumstances,� he told
Elsa,  �for  it  lifts  me  impersonally  from  the  vale  of  tears  into  peaceful
spheres.�74

With the approach of the spring of 1914 and their move to Berlin, Eduard
came  down  with  an  ear  infection  that  made  it  necessary  for  Mari  to  take
him  to  an  Alpine  resort  to  recover.  �This  has  a  good  side,�  Einstein  told
Elsa. He would initially be traveling to Berlin alone, and �in order to savor
that,� he decided to skip a conference in Paris so that he could arrive earlier.
On one of their last evenings in Zurich, he and Mari  went to the Hurwitz
house  for  a  farewell  musical  evening.  Once  again,  the  program  featured
Schumann,  in  an  attempt  to  cheer  her  up.  It  didn�t.  She  instead  sat  by
herself in a corner and did not speak to anyone.75

Berlin, 1914

By April 1914, Einstein had settled into a spacious apartment just west of
Berlin�s  city  center.  Mari   had  picked  it  out  when  she  visited  Berlin  over
Christmas  vacation,  and  she  arrived  in  late  April,  after  Eduard�s  ear
infection had subsided.76

The  tensions  in  Einstein�s  domestic  life  were  exacerbated  by  overwork
and mental strain. He was settling into a new job�actually three new jobs
�and  still  struggling  with  his  fitful  attempts  to  generalize  his  theory  of
relativity  and  tie  it  into  a  theory  of  gravity.  That  first  April  in  Berlin,  for
example, he engaged in an intense correspondence with Paul Ehrenfest over
ways to calculate the forces affecting rotating electrons in a magnetic field.
He started writing a theory for such situations, then realized it was wrong.
�The  angel  had  unveiled  itself  halfway  in  its  magnificence,�  he  told
Ehrenfest,  �then  on  further  unveiling  a  cloven  hoof  appeared  and  I  ran
away.�

Even  more  revealing,  perhaps  more  than  he  meant  it  to  be,  was  his
comment  to  Ehrenfest  about  his  personal  life  in  Berlin.�I  really  delight  in
my local relatives,� he reported, �especially in a cousin of my age.�77

 
When  Ehrenfest  came  for  a  visit  at  the  end  of  April,  Mari   had  just
arrived, and he found her gloomy and yearning for Zurich. Einstein, on the
other hand, had thrown himself into his work. �He had the impression that
the family was taking a bit too much of his time, and that he had the duty to
concentrate completely on his work,� his son Hans Albert later recollected
about that fateful spring of 1914.78

Personal  relationships  involve  nature�s  most  mysterious  forces.  Outside
judgments  are  easy  to  make  and  hard  to  verify.  Einstein  repeatedly  and
plaintively  stressed  to  all  of  their  mutual  friends�especially  the  Bessos,
Habers,  and  Zanggers�that  they  should  try  to  see  the  breakup  of  his
marriage from his perspective, despite his own apparent culpability.

It  is  probably  true  that  he  was  not  solely  to  blame.  The  decline  of  the
marriage  was  a  downward  spiral.  He  had  become  emotionally  withdrawn,
Mari  had become more depressed and dark, and each action reinforced the
other.  Einstein  tended  to  avoid  painful  personal  emotions  by  immersing
himself in his work. Mari , for her part, was bitter about the collapse of her
own  dreams  and  increasingly  resentful  of  her  husband�s  success.  Her
jealousy  made  her  hostile  toward  anyone  else  who  was  close  to  Einstein,
including  his  mother  (the  feeling  was  reciprocal)  and  his  friends.  Her
mistrustful  nature  was,  understandably,  to  some  extent  an  effect  of
Einstein�s detachment, but it was also a cause.

By  the  time  they  moved  to  Berlin,  Mari   had  developed  at  least  one
personal involvement of her own, with a mathematics professor in Zagreb
named  Vladimir Vari ak,  who  had  challenged  Einstein�s  interpretations  of
how special relativity applied to a rotating disk. Einstein was aware of the
situation. �He had a kind of relationship with my wife, which can�t be held
against either of them,� he wrote to Zangger in June. �It only made me feel
my sense of isolation doubly painfully.�79

The end came in July. Amid the turmoil, Mari  moved with her two boys
into the house of Fritz Haber, the chemist who�d recruited Einstein and who
ran the institute where his office was located. Haber had his own experience
with  domestic  discord.  His  wife,  Clara,  would  end  up  committing  suicide
the following year after a fight over Haber�s participation in the war. But for
the  time  being,  she  was  Mileva  Mari �s  only  friend  in  Berlin,  and  Fritz
Haber became the intermediary as the Einsteins� battles broke into the open.

Through  the  Habers,  Einstein  delivered  to  Mari   in  mid-July  a  brutal
cease-fire  ultimatum.  It  was  in  the  form  of  a  proposed  contract,  one  in
which  Einstein�s  cold  scientific  approach  combined  with  his  personal
hostility  and  emotional  alienation  to  produce  an  astonishing  document.  It
read in full:

Conditions.

A. You will make sure
1. that my clothes and laundry are kept in good order;
2. that I will receive my three meals regularly in my room;
3.  that  my  bedroom  and  study  are  kept  neat,  and  especially  that  my

desk is left for my use only.

B. You will renounce all personal relations with me insofar as they are
not  completely  necessary  for  social  reasons.  Specifically,  you  will
forego

1. my sitting at home with you;
2. my going out or traveling with you.

C. You will obey the following points in your relations with me:
1. you will not expect any intimacy from me, nor will you reproach me

in any way;

2. you will stop talking to me if I request it;
3. you will leave my bedroom or study immediately without protest if I

request it.

D. You will undertake not to belittle me in front of our children, either

through words or behavior.80

Mari  accepted the  terms.  When Haber  delivered  her response,  Einstein
insisted on writing to her again �so that you are completely clear about the
situation.� He was prepared to live together again �because I don�t want to
lose  the  children  and  I  don�t  want  them  to  lose  me.�  It  was  out  of  the
question that he would have a �friendly� relationship with her, but he would
aim  for  a  �businesslike�  one.  �The  personal  aspects  must  be  reduced  to  a
tiny remnant,� he said. �In return, I assure you of proper comportment on
my part, such as I would exercise to any woman as a stranger.�81

 
Only  then  did  Mari   realize  that  the  relationship  was  not  salvageable.
They  all  met  at  Haber�s  house  on  a  Friday  to  work  out  a  separation
agreement.  It  took  three  hours.  Einstein  agreed  to  provide  Mari   and  his
children 5,600 marks a year, just under half of his primary salary. Haber and
Mari   went  to  a  lawyer  to  have  the  contract  drawn  up;  Einstein  did  not
accompany them, but instead sent his friend Michele Besso, who had come
from Trieste to represent him.82

Einstein left the meeting at Haber�s house and went directly to the home
of Elsa�s parents, who were also his aunt and uncle. They arrived home late
from  dinner  to  find  him  there,  and  they  received  the  news  about  the
situation with �a mild distaste.� Nevertheless, he ended up staying at their
house.  Elsa  was  on  summer  vacation  in  the  Bavarian  Alps  with  her  two
daughters, and Einstein wrote to inform her that he was now sleeping in her
bed  in  the  apartment  upstairs.  �It�s  peculiar  how  confusingly  sentimental
one  gets,�  he  told  her.  �It  is  just  a  bed  like  any  other,  as  though  you  had
never slept in it. And yet I find it comforting.� She had invited him to visit
her  in  the  Bavarian  Alps,  but  he  said  he  could  not,  �for  fear  of  damaging
your reputation again.�83

The way to a divorce had now been paved, he assured Elsa, and he called
it  �a  sacrifice�  he  had  made  on  her  behalf.  Mari   would  move  back  to
Zurich and take custody of the two boys, and when they came to visit their
father they could meet only on �neutral ground,� not in any house he shared
with Elsa. �This is justified,� Einstein conceded to Elsa, �because it is not
right to have the children see their father with a woman other than their own
mother.�

The  prospect  of  parting  with  his  children  was  devastating  for  Einstein.
He  pretended  to  be  detached  from  personal  sentiments,  and  sometimes  he
was.  But  he  became  deeply  emotional  as  he  imagined  life  apart  from  his
sons. �I would be a real monster if I felt any other way,� he wrote Elsa. �I
have carried these children around innumerable times day and night, taken
them  out  in  their  pram,  played  with  them,  romped  around  and  joked  with
them. They used to shout with joy when I came; the little one cheered even
now, because he was still too small to grasp the situation. Now they will be
gone forever, and their image of their father is being spoiled.�84

Mari   and  the  two  boys  left  Berlin,  accompanied  by  Michele  Besso,
aboard  the  morning  train  to  Zurich  on  Wednesday,  July  29,  1914.  Haber
went  to  the  station  with  Einstein,  who  �bawled  like  a  little  boy�  all

afternoon  and  evening.  It  was  the  most  wrenching  personal  moment  for  a
man who took perverse pride in avoiding personal moments. For all of his
reputation of being inured to deep human attachments, he had been madly
in love with Mileva Mari  and bonded to  his  children.  For one of the  few
times in his adult life, he found himself crying.

The next day he went to visit his mother, who cheered him up. She had
never liked Mari  and was  delighted that she was  gone. �Oh,  if  your poor
Papa  had  only  lived  to  see  it!�  she  said  about  the  separation.  She  even
professed herself pleased for Elsa, although they had occasionally clashed.
And  Elsa�s  mother  and  father  also  seemed  happy  enough  with  the
resolution,  though  they  did  express  resentment  that  Einstein  had  been  too
financially generous to Mari , which meant the income left for him and Elsa
might be �a bit meager.�85

The whole ordeal left Einstein so drained that, despite what he had said
to  Elsa  just  a  week  earlier,  he  decided  that  he  was  not  prepared  to  get
married again. Thus he would not have to force the issue of a legal divorce,
which  Mari   fiercely  resisted.  Elsa,  still  on  vacation,  was  �bitterly
disappointed� by the news. Einstein sought to reassure her. �For me there is
no  other  female  creature  besides  you,�  he  wrote.  �It  is  not  a  lack  of  true
affection which scares me away again and again from marriage! Is it a fear
of the comfortable life, of nice furniture, of the odium that I burden myself
with or even of becoming some sort of contented bourgeois? I myself don�t
know; but you will see that my attachment to you will endure.�

He  insisted  that  she  should  not  feel  ashamed  or  let  people  pity  her  for
consorting  with  a  man  who  would  not  marry  her.  They  would  take  walks
together and be there for each other. Should she choose to offer even more,
he  would  be  grateful.  But  by  not  marrying,  they  would  be  protecting
themselves  from  lapsing  into  a  �contented  bourgeois�  existence  and
preventing  their  relationship  �from  becoming  banal  and  from  growing
pale.�  To  him,  marriage  was  confining,  which  was  a  state  he  instinctively
resisted. �I�m glad our delicate relationship does not have to founder on a
provincial narrow-minded lifestyle.�86

In the old days, Mari  had been the type of soul mate who responded to
such bohemian sentiments. Elsa was not such a person. A comfortable life
with  comfortable  furniture  appealed  to  her.  So  did  marriage.  She  would
accept his decision not to get married for a while, but not forever.

In  the  meantime,  Einstein  became  embroiled  in  a  long-distance  battle
with  Mari   over  money,  furniture,  and  the  way  she  was  allegedly
�poisoning�  their  children  against  him.87  And  all  around  them,  a  chain
reaction was taking Europe into the most incomprehensibly bloody war in
its history.

Not  surprisingly,  Einstein  reacted  to  all  of  this  turmoil  by  throwing

himself into his science.

CHAPTER NINE
GENERAL RELATIVITY
1911�1915

Light and Gravity

After  Einstein  formulated  his  special  theory  of  relativity  in  1905,  he
realized  that  it  was  incomplete  in  at  least  two  ways.  First,  it  held  that  no
physical  interaction  can  propagate  faster  than  the  speed  of  light;  that
conflicted with Newton�s theory of gravity, which conceived of gravity as a
force that acted instantly between distant objects. Second, it applied only to
constant-velocity motion. So for the next ten years, Einstein engaged in an
interwoven  effort  to  come  up  with  a  new  field  theory  of  gravity  and  to
generalize his relativity theory so that it applied to accelerated motion.1

His first major conceptual advance had come at the end of 1907, while he
was  writing  about  relativity  for  a  science  yearbook.  As  noted  earlier,  a
thought experiment about what a free-falling observer would feel led him to
embrace the principle that the local effects of being accelerated and of being
in  a  gravitational  field  are  indistinguishable.*  A  person  in  a  closed
windowless chamber who feels his feet pressed to the floor will not be able
to tell whether it�s because the chamber is in outer space being accelerated
upward  or  because  it  is  at  rest  in  a  gravitational  field.  If  he  pulls  a  penny
from  his  pocket  and  lets  it  go,  it  will  fall  to  the  floor  at  an  accelerating
speed  in  either  case.  Likewise,  a  person  who  feels  she  is  floating  in  the
closed  chamber will not  know whether  it�s because  the  chamber is  in  free
fall or hovering in a gravity-free region of outer space.2

This  led  Einstein  to  the  formulation  of  an  �equivalence  principle�  that
would guide his quest for a theory of gravity and his attempt to generalize

 
 
relativity.  �I  realized  that  I  would  be  able  to  extend  or  generalize  the
principle  of  relativity  to  apply  to  accelerated  systems  in  addition  to  those
moving  at  a  uniform  velocity,�  he  later  explained.  �And  in  so  doing,  I
expected  that  I  would  be  able  to  resolve  the  problem  of  gravitation  at  the
same time.�

Just as inertial mass and gravitational mass are equivalent, so too there is
an equivalence, he realized, between all inertial effects, such as resistance to
acceleration, and gravitational effects, such as weight. His insight was that
they  are  both  manifestations  of  the  same  structure,  which  we  now
sometimes call the inertio-gravitational field.3

One  consequence  of  this  equivalence  is  that  gravity,  as  Einstein  had
noted,  should  bend  a  light  beam.  That  is  easy  to  show  using  the  chamber
thought experiment. Imagine that the chamber is being accelerated upward.
A  laser  beam  comes  in  through  a  pinhole  on  one  wall.  By  the  time  it
reaches  the  opposite  wall,  it�s  a  little  closer  to  the  floor,  because  the
chamber  has  shot  upward.  And  if  you  could  plot  its  trajectory  across  the
chamber,  it  would  be  curved  because  of  the  upward  acceleration.  The
equivalence  principle  says  that  this  effect  should  be  the  same  whether  the
chamber is accelerating upward or is instead resting still in a gravitational
field. Thus, light should appear to bend when going through a gravitational
field.

For almost four years after positing this principle, Einstein did little with
it. Instead, he focused on light quanta. But in 1911, he confessed to Michele
Besso  that  he  was  weary  of  worrying  about  quanta,  and  he  turned  his
attention back to coming up with a field theory of gravity that would help
him  generalize  relativity.  It  was  a  task  that  would  take  him  almost  four
more years, culminating in an eruption of genius in November 1915.

In  a  paper  he  sent  to  the  Annalen  der  Physik  in  June  1911,  �On  the
Influence of Gravity on the Propagation of Light,� he picked up his insight
from  1907  and  gave  it  rigorous  expression.  �In  a  memoir  published  four
years ago I tried to answer the question whether the propagation of light is
influenced  by  gravitation,�  he  began.  �I  now  see  that  one  of  the  most
important consequences of my former treatment is capable of being tested
experimentally.�  After  a  series  of  calculations,  Einstein  came  up  with  a
prediction for  light  passing  through  the  gravitational  field  next  to  the  sun:
�A  ray  of  light  going  past  the  sun  would  undergo  a  deflection  of  0.83
second of arc.�*

Once  again,  he  was  deducing  a  theory  from  grand  principles  and
postulates, then deriving some predictions that experimenters could proceed
to test. As before, he ended his paper by calling for just such a test. �As the
stars in the parts of the sky near the sun are visible during total eclipses of
the sun, this consequence of the theory may be observed. It would be a most
desirable thing if astronomers would take up the question.�4

Erwin  Finlay  Freundlich,  a  young  astronomer  at  the  Berlin  University
observatory,  read  the  paper  and  became  excited  by  the  prospect  of  doing
this  test.  But  it  could  not  be  performed  until  an  eclipse,  when  starlight
passing near the sun would be visible, and there would be no suitable one
for another three years.

So Freundlich proposed that he try to measure the deflection of starlight
caused by the gravitational field of Jupiter. Alas, Jupiter did not prove big
enough  for  the  task.  �If  only  we  had  a  truly  larger  planet  than  Jupiter!�
Einstein joked to Freundlich at the end of that summer. �But nature did not
deem it her business to make the discovery of her laws easy for us.�5

The  theory  that  light  beams  could  be  bent  led  to  some  interesting
questions.  Everyday  experience  shows  that  light  travels  in  straight  lines.
Carpenters now use laser levels to mark off straight lines and construct level
houses.  If  a  light  beam  curves  as  it  passes  through  regions  of  changing
gravitational fields, how can a straight line be determined?

One  solution  might  be  to  liken  the  path  of  the  light  beam  through  a
changing  gravitational  field  to  that  of  a  line  drawn  on  a  sphere  or  on  a
surface that is warped. In such cases, the shortest line between two points is
curved,  a  geodesic  like  a  great  arc  or  a  great  circle  route  on  our  globe.
Perhaps the bending of light meant that the fabric of space, through which
the light beam traveled, was curved by gravity. The shortest path through a
region  of  space  that  is  curved  by  gravity  might  seem  quite  different  from
the straight lines of Euclidean geometry.

There was another clue that a new form of geometry might be needed. It
became apparent to Einstein when he considered the case of a rotating disk.
As  a  disk  whirled  around,  its  circumference  would  be  contracted  in  the
direction of its motion when observed from the reference frame of a person
not rotating with it. The diameter of the circle, however, would not undergo
any contraction. Thus, the ratio of the disk�s circumference to its diameter
would no longer be given by pi. Euclidean geometry wouldn�t apply to such
cases.

Rotating  motion  is  a  form  of  acceleration,  because  at  every  moment  a
point on the rim is undergoing a change in direction, which means that its
velocity  (a  combination  of  speed  and  direction)  is  undergoing  a  change.
Because non-Euclidean geometry would be necessary to describe this type
of acceleration, according to the equivalence principle, it would be needed
for gravitation as well.6

Unfortunately, as he had proved at the Zurich Polytechnic, non-Euclidean
geometry  was  not  a  strong  suit  for  Einstein.  Fortunately,  he  had  an  old
friend and classmate in Zurich for whom it was.

The Math

When Einstein moved back to Zurich from Prague in July 1912, one of
the  first  things  he  did  was  call  on  his  friend  Marcel  Grossmann,  who  had
taken  the  notes  Einstein  used  when  he  skipped  math  classes  at  the  Zurich
Polytechnic. Einstein had gotten a 4.25 out of 6 in his two geometry courses
at the Polytechnic. Grossmann, on the other hand, had scored a perfect 6 in
both of his geometry courses, had written his dissertation on non-Euclidean
geometry, published seven papers on that topic, and was now the chairman
of the math department.7

�Grossmann, you�ve got to help me or I will go crazy,� Einstein said. He
explained  that  he  needed  a  mathematical  system  that  would  express�and
perhaps  even  help  him  discover�the  laws  that  governed  the  gravitational
field.  �Instantly,  he  was  all  afire,�  Einstein  recalled  of  Grossmann�s
response.8

Until  then,  Einstein�s  scientific  success  had  been  based  on  his  special
talent for sniffing out the underlying physical principles of nature. He had
left to others the task, which to him seemed less exalted, of finding the best
mathematical  expressions  of  those  principles,  as  his  Zurich  colleague
Minkowski had done for special relativity.

But by 1912, Einstein had come to appreciate that math could be a tool
for  discovering�and  not  merely  describing�nature�s  laws.  Math  was
nature�s  playbook.  �The  central  idea  of  general  relativity  is  that  gravity
arises  from  the  curvature  of  spacetime,�  says  physicist  James  Hartle.
�Gravity is geometry.�9

 
�I am now working exclusively on the gravitation problem and I believe
that,  with  the  help  of  a  mathematician  friend  here,  I  will  overcome  all
difficulties,�  Einstein  wrote  to  the  physicist  Arnold  Sommerfeld.  �I  have
gained  enormous  respect  for  mathematics,  whose  more  subtle  parts  I
considered until now, in my ignorance, as pure luxury!�10

Grossmann went home to think about the question. After consulting the
literature,  he  came  back  to  Einstein  and  recommended  the  non-Euclidean
geometry that had been devised by Bernhard Riemann.11

Riemann  (1826�1866)  was  a  child  prodigy  who  invented  a  perpetual
calendar at age 14 as a gift for his parents and went on to study in the great
math  center  of  G�ttingen,  Germany,  under  Carl  Friedrich  Gauss,  who  had
been pioneering the geometry of curved surfaces. This was the topic Gauss
assigned to  Riemann for  a thesis,  and the  result  would transform not  only
geometry but physics.

Euclidean geometry describes flat surfaces. But it does not hold true on
curved surfaces. For example, the sum of the angles of a triangle on a flat
page  is  180�.  But  look  at  the  globe  and  picture  a  triangle  formed  by  the
equator  as  the  base,  the  line  of  longitude  running  from  the  equator  to  the
North  Pole  through  London  (longitude  0�)  as  one  side,  and  the  line  of
longitude running from the equator to the North Pole through New Orleans
(longitude 90�) as the third side. If you look at this on a globe, you will see
that  all  three  angles  of  this  triangle  are  right  angles,  which  of  course  is
impossible in the flat world of Euclid.

Gauss  and  others  had  developed  different  types  of  geometry  that  could
describe  the  surface  of  spheres  and  other  curved  surfaces.  Riemann  took
things even further: he developed a way to describe a surface no matter how
its geometry changed, even if it varied from spherical to flat to hyperbolic
from one point to the next. He also went beyond dealing with the curvature
of  just  two-dimensional  surfaces  and,  building  on  the  work  of  Gauss,
explored the various ways that math could describe the curvature of three-
dimensional and even four-dimensional space.

That is a challenging concept. We can visualize a curved line or surface,
but  it  is  hard  to  imagine  what  curved  three-dimensional  space  would  be
like,  much  less  a  curved  four  dimensions.  But  for  mathematicians,
extending  the  concept  of  curvature  into  different  dimensions  is  easy,  or  at
least doable. This involves using the concept of the metric, which specifies
how to calculate the distance between two points in space.

On  a  flat  surface  with  just  the  normal  x  and  y  coordinates,  any  high
school  algebra  student,  with  the  help  of  old  Pythagoras,  can  calculate  the
distance between points. But imagine a flat map (of the world, for example)
that  represents  locations  on  what  is  actually  a  curved  globe.  Things  get
stretched  out  near  the  poles,  and  measurement  gets  more  complex.
Calculating the actual distance between two points on the map in Greenland
is different from doing so for points near the equator. Riemann worked out
ways to determine mathematically the distance between points in space no
matter how arbitrarily it curved and contorted.12

To  do  so  he  used  something  called  a  tensor.  In  Euclidean  geometry,  a
vector is a quantity (such as of velocity or force) that has both a magnitude
and a direction and thus needs more than a single simple number to describe
it.  In  non-Euclidean  geometry,  where  space  is  curved,  we  need  something
more generalized�sort of a vector on steroids�in order to incorporate, in a
mathematically orderly way, more components. These are called tensors.

A metric tensor is a mathematical tool that tells us how to calculate the
distance  between  points  in  a  given  space.  For  two-dimensional  maps,  a
metric tensor has three components. For three-dimensional space, it has six
independent  components.  And  once  you  get  to  that  glorious  four-
dimensional  entity  known  as  spacetime,  the  metric  tensor  needs  ten
independent components.*

Riemann helped to develop this concept of the metric tensor, which was
denoted as gmn and pronounced gee-mu-nu. It had sixteen components, ten
of  them  independent  of  one  another,  that  could  be  used  to  define  and
describe a distance in curved four-dimensional spacetime.13

The  useful  thing  about  Riemann�s  tensor,  as  well  as  other  tensors  that
Einstein and Grossmann adopted from the Italian mathematicians Gregorio
Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita, is that they are generally covariant.
This was an important concept for Einstein as he tried to generalize a theory
of  relativity.  It  meant  that  the  relationships  between  their  components
remained the same even when there were arbitrary changes or rotations in
the  space  and  time  coordinate  system.  In  other  words,  the  information
encoded  in  these  tensors  could  go  through  a  variety  of  transformations
based  on  a  changing  frame  of  reference,  but  the  basic  laws  governing  the
relationship of the components to each other remained the same.14

Einstein�s goal as he pursued his general theory of relativity was to find

the mathematical equations describing two complementary processes:

1. How a gravitational field acts on matter, telling it how to move.
2. And in turn, how matter generates gravitational fields in space-time,

telling it how to curve.

His  head-snapping  insight  was  that  gravity  could  be  defined  as  the
curvature of spacetime, and thus it could be represented by a metric tensor.
For more than three years he would fitfully search for the right equations to
accomplish his mission.15

Years later, when his younger son, Eduard, asked why he was so famous,
Einstein  replied  by  using  a  simple  image  to  describe  his  great  insight  that
gravity  was  the  curving  of  the  fabric  of  spacetime.  �When  a  blind  beetle
crawls over the surface of a curved branch, it doesn�t notice that the track it
has covered is indeed curved,� he said. �I was lucky enough to notice what
the beetle didn�t notice.�16

The Zurich Notebook, 1912

Beginning  in  that  summer  of  1912,  Einstein  struggled  to  develop
gravitational  field  equations  using  tensors  along  the  lines  developed  by
Riemann, Ricci, and others. His first round of fitful efforts are preserved in
a  scratchpad  notebook.  Over  the  years,  this  revealing  �Zurich  Notebook�
has  been  dissected  and  analyzed  by  a  team  of  scholars  including  J�rgen
Renn, John D. Norton, Tilman Sauer, Michel Janssen, and John Stachel.17

In  it  Einstein  pursued  a  two-fisted  approach.  On  the  one  hand,  he
engaged in what was called a �physical strategy,� in which he tried to build
the correct equations from a set of requirements dictated by his feel for the
physics. At the same time, he pursued a �mathematical strategy,� in which
he  tried  to  deduce  the  correct  equations  from  the  more  formal  math
requirements  using  the  tensor  analysis  that  Gross-mann  and  others
recommended.

Einstein�s  �physical  strategy�  began  with  his  mission  to  generalize  the
principle of relativity so that it applied to observers who were accelerating
or  moving  in  an  arbitrary  manner.  Any  gravitational  field  equation  he
devised would have to meet the following physical requirements:

 
 
�  It  must  revert  to  Newtonian  theory  in  the  special  case  of  weak  and
static  gravitational  fields.  In  other  words,  under  certain  normal
conditions,  his  theory  would  describe  Newton�s  familiar  laws  of
gravitation and motion.

�  It  should  preserve  the  laws  of  classical  physics,  most  notably  the

conservation of energy and momentum.

�  It  should  satisfy  the  principle  of  equivalence,  which  holds  that
observations  made  by  an  observer  who  is  uniformly  accelerating
would  be  equivalent  to  those  made  by  an  observer  standing  in  a
comparable gravitational field.

Einstein�s  �mathematical  strategy,�  on  the  other  hand,  focused  on  using
generic  mathematical  knowledge  about  the  metric  tensor  to  find  a
gravitational  field  equation  that  was  generally  (or  at  least  broadly)
covariant.

The  process  worked  both  ways:  Einstein  would  examine  equations  that
were  abstracted  from  his  physical  requirements  to  check  their  covariance
properties,  and  he  would  examine  equations  that  sprang  from  elegant
mathematical  formulations  to  see  if  they  met  the  requirements  of  his
physics.  �On  page after page of the  notebook,  he approached  the  problem
from  either  side,  here  writing  expressions  suggested  by  the  physical
requirements  of  the  Newtonian  limit  and  energy-momentum  conservation,
there  writing  expressions  naturally  suggested  by  the  generally  covariant
quantities supplied by the mathematics of Ricci and Levi-Civita,� says John
Norton.18

But something disappointing happened. The two groups of requirements
did not mesh. Or at least Einstein thought not. He could not get the results
produced by one strategy to meet the requirements of the other strategy.

Using his mathematical strategy, he derived some very elegant equations.
At  Grossmann�s  suggestion,  he  had  begun  using  a  tensor  developed  by
Riemann and then a more suitable one developed by Ricci. Finally, by the
end  of  1912,  he  had  devised  a  field  equation  using  a  tensor  that  was,  it
turned  out,  pretty  close  to  the  one  that  he  would  eventually  use  in  his
triumphant  formulation  of  late  November  1915.  In  other  words,  in  his
Zurich  Notebook  he  had  come  up  with  what  was  quite  close  to  the  right
solution.19

But then he rejected it, and it would stagnate in his discard pile for more
than two years. Why? Among other considerations, he thought (somewhat
mistakenly) that this solution did not reduce, in a weak and static field, to
Newton�s  laws.  When  he  tried  it  a  different  way,  it  did  not  meet  the
requirement  of  the  conservation  of  energy  and  momentum.  And  if  he
introduced a coordinate condition that allowed the equations to satisfy one
of these requirements, it proved incompatible with the conditions needed to
satisfy the other requirement.20

As a result, Einstein reduced his reliance on the mathematical strategy. It
was a decision that he would later regret. Indeed, after he finally returned to
the mathematical strategy and it proved spectacularly successful, he would
from  then  on  proclaim  the  virtues�both  scientific  and  philosophical�of
mathematical formalism.21

The Entwurf and Newton�s Bucket, 1913

In  May  1913,  having  discarded  the  equations  derived  from  the
mathematical  strategy,  Einstein  and  Grossmann  produced  a  sketchy
alternative  theory  based  more  on  the  physical  strategy.  Its  equations  were
the  requirements  of  energy-momentum
constructed 
conservation and of being compatible with Newton�s laws in a weak static
field.

to  conform 

to 

Even  though  it  did  not  seem  that  these  equations  satisfied  the  goal  of
being  suitably  covariant,  Einstein  and  Grossmann  felt  it  was  the  best  they
could  do  for  the  time  being.  Their  title  reflected  their  tentativeness:
�Outline  of  a  Generalized  Theory  of  Relativity  and  of  a  Theory  of
Gravitation.� The paper thus became known as the Entwurf, which was the
German word they had used for �outline.�22

For a few months after producing the Entwurf, Einstein was both pleased
and  depleted.  �I  finally  solved  the  problem  a  few  weeks  ago,�  he  wrote
Elsa.  �It  is  a  bold  extension  of  the  theory  of  relativity,  together  with  a
theory of gravitation. Now I must give myself some rest, otherwise I will go
kaput.�23

However, he was soon questioning what he had wrought. And the more
he reflected on the Entwurf, the more he realized that its equations did not

 
satisfy  the  goal  of  being  generally  or  even  broadly  covariant.  In  other
words,  the  way  the  equations  applied  to  people  in  arbitrary  accelerated
motion might not always be the same.

His confidence in the theory was not strengthened when he sat down with
his old friend Michele Besso, who had come to visit him in June 1913, to
study the implications of the Entwurf theory. They produced more than fifty
pages  of  notes  on  their  deliberations,  each  writing  about  half,  which
analyzed  how  the  Entwurf  accorded  with  some  curious  facts  that  were
known about the orbit of Mercury.24

Since  the  1840s,  scientists  had  been  worrying  about  a  small  but
unexplained  shift  in  the  orbit  of  Mercury.  The  perihelion  is  the  spot  in  a
planet�s elliptical orbit when it is closest to the sun, and over the years this
spot in Mercury�s orbit had slipped a tiny amount more�about 43 seconds
of an arc each century�than what was explained by Newton�s laws. At first
it was assumed that some undiscovered planet was tugging at it, similar to
the  reasoning  that  had  earlier  led  to  the  discovery  of  Neptune.  The
Frenchman who discovered Mercury�s anomaly even calculated where such
a planet would be and named it Vulcan. But it was not there.

Einstein  hoped  that  his  new  theory  of  relativity,  when  its  gravitational
field  equations  were  applied  to  the  sun,  would  explain  Mercury�s  orbit.
Unfortunately,  after  a  lot  of  calculations  and  corrected  mistakes,  he  and
Besso came up with a value of 18 seconds of an arc per century for how far
Mercury�s perihelion should stray, which was not even halfway correct. The
poor result convinced Einstein not to publish the Mercury calculations. But
it did not convince him to discard his Entwurf theory, at least not yet.

Einstein and Besso also looked at whether rotation could be considered a
form of relative motion under the equations of the Entwurf theory. In other
words, imagine that an observer is rotating and thus experiencing inertia. Is
it  possible  that  this  is  yet  another  case  of  relative  motion  and  is
indistinguishable  from  a  case  where  the  observer  is  at  rest  and  the  rest  of
the universe is rotating around him?

The  most  famous  thought  experiment  along  these  lines  was  that
described by  Newton  in  the  third  book of his Principia.  Imagine  a bucket
that begins to rotate as it hangs from a rope. At first the water in the bucket
stays rather still and flat. But soon the friction from the bucket causes the
water  to  spin  around  with  it,  and  it  assumes  a  concave  shape.  Why?

Because inertia causes the spinning water to push outward, and therefore it
pushes up the side of the bucket.

Yes,  but  if  we  suspect  that  all  motion  is  relative,  we  ask:  What  is  the
water  spinning  relative  to?  Not  the  bucket,  because  the  water  is  concave
when it is spinning along with the bucket, and also when the bucket stops
and  the  water  keeps  spinning  inside  for  a  while.  Perhaps  the  water  is
spinning relative to nearby bodies such as the earth that exert gravitational
force.

But  imagine  the  bucket  spinning  in  deep  space  with  no  gravity  and  no
reference  points.  Or  imagine  it  spinning  alone  in  an  otherwise  empty
universe. Would there still be inertia? Newton believed so, and said it was
because the bucket was spinning relative to absolute space.

When Einstein�s early hero Ernst Mach came along in the mid-nineteenth
century,  he  debunked  this  notion  of  absolute  space  and  argued  that  the
inertia  existed  because  the  water  was  spinning  relative  to  the  rest  of  the
matter  in  the  universe.  Indeed,  the  same  effects  would  be  observed  if  the
bucket  was  still  and  the  rest  of  the  universe  was  rotating  around  it,  he
said.25

The  general  theory  of  relativity,  Einstein  hoped,  would  have  what  he
dubbed  �Mach�s  Principle�  as  one  of  its  touchstones.  Happily,  when  he
analyzed  the  equations  in  his  Entwurf  theory,  he  concluded  that  they  did
seem  to  predict  that  the  effects  would  be  the  same  whether  a  bucket  was
spinning or was motionless while the rest of the universe spun around it.

Or  so  Einstein  thought.  He  and  Besso  made  a  series  of  very  clever
calculations designed to see if indeed this was the case. In their notebook,
Einstein  wrote  a  joyous  little  exclamation  at  what  appeared  to  be  the
successful conclusion of these calculations: �Is correct.�

Unfortunately,  he  and  Besso  had  made  some  mistakes  in  this  work.
Einstein would eventually discover those errors two years later and realize,
unhappily, that the Entwurf  did  not  in  fact  satisfy  Mach�s  principle.  In  all
likelihood, Besso had already warned him that this might be the case. In a
memo  that  he  apparently  wrote  in  August  1913,  Besso  suggested  that  a
�rotation metric� was not in fact a solution permitted by the field equations
in the Entwurf.

But  Einstein  dismissed  these  doubts,  in  letters  to  Besso  as  well  as  to
Mach  and  others,  at  least  for  the  time  being.26  If  experiments  upheld  the
theory,  �your  brilliant  investigations  on  the  foundations  of  mechanics  will

have received a splendid confirmation,� Einstein wrote to Mach days after
the Entwurf was published. �For it shows that inertia has its origin in some
kind of interaction of the bodies, exactly in accordance with your argument
about Newton�s bucket experiment.�27

What  worried  Einstein  most  about  the  Entwurf,  justifiably,  was  that  its
mathematical  equations  did  not  prove  to  be  generally  covariant,  thus
deflating his goal of assuring that the laws of nature were the same for an
observer  in  accelerated  or  arbitrary  motion  as  they  were  for  an  observer
moving  at  a  constant  velocity.  �Regrettably,  the  whole  business  is  still  so
very  tricky  that  my  confidence  in  the  theory  is  still  rather  hesitant,�  he
wrote  in  reply  to  a  warm  letter  of  congratulations  from  Lorentz.�The
gravitational  equations  themselves  unfortunately  do  not  have  the  property
of general covariance.�28

He was soon able to convince himself, at least for a while, that this was
inevitable.  In  part  he  did  so  through  a  thought  experiment,  which  became
known as the �hole argument,�29 that seemed to suggest that the holy grail
of  making  the  gravitational  field  equations  generally  covariant  was
impossible to reach, or at least physically uninteresting. �The fact that the
gravitational  equations  are  not  generally  covariant,  something  that  quite
disturbed me for a while, is unavoidable,� he wrote a friend. �It can easily
be shown that a theory with generally covariant equations cannot exist if the
demand is made that the field is mathematically completely determined by
matter.�30

For the time being, very few physicists embraced Einstein�s new theory,
and many came forth to denounce it.31 Einstein professed pleasure that the
issue of relativity �has at least been taken up with the requisite vigor,� as he
put it to his friend Zangger. �I enjoy controversies. In the manner of Figaro:
�Would  my  noble  Lord  venture  a  little  dance?  He  should  tell  me!  I  will
strike up the tune for him.� �32

Through it all, Einstein continued to try to salvage his Entwurf approach.
He was able to find ways, or so he thought, to achieve enough covariance to
satisfy  most  aspects  of  his  principle  about  the  equivalence  of  gravity  and
acceleration.  �I  succeeded  in  proving  that  the  gravitational  equations  hold
for arbitrarily moving reference systems, and thus that the hypothesis of the
equivalence of acceleration and gravitational field is absolutely correct,� he
wrote Zangger in early 1914. �Nature shows us only the tail of the lion. But

I have no doubt that the lion belongs with it even if he cannot reveal himself
all at once. We see him only the way a louse that sits upon him would.�33

Freundlich and the 1914 Eclipse

There was, Einstein knew, one way to quell doubts. He often concluded
his  papers  with  suggestions  for  how  future  experiments  could  confirm
whatever  he  had  just  propounded.  In  the  case  of  general  relativity,  this
process  had  begun  in  1911,  when  he  specified  with  some  precision  how
much he thought light from a star would be deflected by the gravity of the
sun.

This was something that could, he hoped, be measured by photographing
stars  whose  light  passed  close  to  the  sun  and  determining  whether  there
appeared to be a tiny shift in their position compared to when their light did
not have to pass right by the sun. But this was an experiment that had to be
done during an eclipse, when the starlight would be visible.

So it was not surprising that, with his theory arousing noisy attacks from
colleagues  and  quiet  doubts  in  his  own  mind,  Einstein  became  keenly
interested in what could be discovered during the next suitable total eclipse
of the sun, which was due to occur on August 21, 1914. That would require
an expedition to the Crimea, in Russia, where the path of the eclipse would
fall.

Einstein  was  so  eager  to  have  his  theory  tested  during  the  eclipse  that,
when it seemed there might be no money for such an expedition, he offered
to  pay  part  of  the  costs  himself.  Erwin  Freundlich,  the  young  Berlin
astronomer  who  had  read  the  light-bending  predictions  in  Einstein�s  1911
paper and become eager to prove him correct, was ready to take the lead. �I
am extremely pleased that you have taken up the question of the bending of
light with so much zeal,� Einstein wrote him in early 1912. In August 1913,
he was still bombarding the astronomer with encouragement.�Nothing more
can be done by the theorists,� he wrote. �In this matter it is only you, the
astronomers,  who  can  next  year  perform  a  simply  invaluable  service  to
theoretical physics.�34

Freundlich  got  married  in  August  1913  and  decided  to  take  his
honeymoon  in  the  mountains  near  Zurich,  in  the  hope  that  he  could  meet
Einstein. It worked. When Freundlich described his honeymoon schedule in

 
a letter, Einstein invited him over for a visit. �This is wonderful because it
fits in with our plans,� Freundlich wrote his fianc�e, whose reaction to the
prospect of spending part of her honeymoon with a theoretical physicist she
had never met is lost to history.

When  the  newlyweds  pulled  into  the  Zurich  train  station,  there  was  a
disheveled  Einstein  wearing,  as  Freundlich�s  wife  recalled,  a  large  straw
hat,  with  the  plump  chemist  Fritz  Haber  at  his  side.  Einstein  brought  the
group to a nearby town where he was giving a lecture, after which he took
them to lunch. Not surprisingly, he had forgotten to bring any money, and
an  assistant  who  had  come  along  slipped  him  a  100  franc  note  under  the
table. For most of the day, Freundlich discussed gravity and the bending of
light with Einstein, even when the group went on a nature hike, leaving his
new wife to admire the scenery in peace.35

At his speech that day, which was on general relativity, Einstein pointed
out Freundlich to the audience and called him �the man who will be testing
the theory next year.�The problem, however, was raising the money. At the
time, Planck and others were trying to lure Einstein from Zurich to Berlin to
become  a  member  of  the  Prussian  Academy,  and  Einstein  used  the
courtship to write Planck and urge him to provide Freundlich the money to
undertake the task.

In  fact,  on  the  very  day  that  Einstein  formally  accepted  the  Berlin  post
and  election  to  the  Academy�December  7,  1913�he  wrote  Freundlich
with  the  offer  to  reach  into  his  own  pocket.  �If  the  Academy  shies  away
from it, then we will get that little bit of mammon from private individuals,�
said Einstein. �Should everything fail, then I will pay for the thing myself
out  of  the  little  bit  that  I  have  saved,  at  least  the  first  2,000  marks.�  The
main thing, Einstein stressed, was that Freundlich should proceed with his
preparations. �Just go ahead and order the photographic plates, and do not
let the time be squandered because of the money problem.�36

As  it  turned  out,  there  were  enough  private  donations,  mainly  from  the
Krupp Foundation, to make the expedition possible. �You can imagine how
happy I am that the external difficulties of your undertaking have now more
or  less  been  overcome,�  Einstein  wrote.  He  added  a  note  of  confidence
about  what  would  be  found:  �I  have  considered  the  theory  from  every
angle, and I have every confidence in the thing.�37

Freundlich  and  two  colleagues  left  Berlin  on  July  19  for  the  Crimea,
where  they  were  joined  by  a  group  from  the  C�rdoba  observatory  in

Argentina.  If  all  went  well,  they  would  have  two  minutes  to  make
photographs  that  could  be  used  to  analyze  whether  the  starlight  was
deflected by the sun�s gravity.

All did not go well. Twenty days before the eclipse, Europe tumbled into
World  War  I  and  Germany  declared  war  on  Russia.  Freundlich  and  his
German colleagues were captured by the Russian army, and their equipment
was confiscated. Not surprisingly, they were unable to convince the Russian
soldiers that, with all of their powerful cameras and location devices, they
were  mere  astronomers  planning  to  gaze  at  the  stars  in  order  to  better
understand the secrets of the universe.

Even  if  they  had  been  granted  safe  passage,  it  is  likely  that  the
observations would have failed. The skies were cloudy during the minutes
of  the  eclipse,  and  an  American  group  that  was  also  in  the  region  was
unable to get any usable photographs.38

Yet the termination of the eclipse mission had a silver lining. Einstein�s
Entwurf  equations  were  not  correct.  The  degree  to  which  gravity  would
deflect light, according to Einstein�s theory at the time, was the same as that
predicted  by  Newton�s  emission  theory  of  light.  But,  as  Einstein  would
discover a year later, the correct prediction would end up being twice that.
If  Freundlich  had  succeeded  in  1914,  Einstein  might  have  been  publicly
proven wrong.

�My  good  old  astronomer  Freundlich,  instead  of  experiencing  a  solar
eclipse in Russia, will now be experiencing captivity there,� Einstein wrote
to his friend Ehrenfest. �I am concerned about him.�39There was no need to
worry.  The  young  astronomer  was  released  in  a  prisoner  exchange  within
weeks.

Einstein,  however,  had  other  reasons  to  worry  in  August  1914.  His
marriage had just exploded. His masterpiece theory still needed work. And
now  his  native  country�s  nationalism  and  militarism,  traits  that  he  had
abhorred since childhood, had plunged it into a war that would cast him as a
stranger  in  a  strange  land.  In  Germany,  it  would  turn  out,  that  was  a
dangerous position to be in.

World War I

 
The chain reaction that pushed Europe into war in August 1914 inflamed
the  patriotic  pride  of the  Prussians and, in  an equal  and opposite  reaction,
the visceral pacifism of Einstein, a man so gentle and averse to conflict that
he even disliked playing chess. �Europe in its madness has now embarked
on something incredibly preposterous,� he wrote Ehrenfest that month. �At
such times one sees to what deplorable breed of brutes we belong.�40

Ever since he ran away from Germany as a schoolboy and was exposed
to  the  gauzy  internationalism  of  Jost  Winteler  in  Aarau,  Einstein  had
harbored  sentiments  that  disposed  him  toward  pacifism,  one-world
federalism, and socialism. But he had generally shunned public activism.

World War I changed that. Einstein would never forsake physics, but he
would henceforth be unabashedly public, for most of his life, in pushing his
political and social ideals.

The  irrationality  of  the  war  made  Einstein  believe  that  scientists  in  fact
had  a  special  duty  to  engage  in  public  affairs.  �We  scientists  in  particular
must  foster  internationalism,�  he  said.  �Unfortunately,  we  have  had  to
suffer  serious disappointments  even among  scientists in  this regard.�41 He
was  especially  appalled  by  the  lockstep  pro-war  mentality  of  his  three
closest colleagues, the scientists who had lured him to Berlin: Fritz Haber,
Walther Nernst, and Max Planck.42

Haber  was  a  short,  bald,  and  dapper  chemist  who  was  born  Jewish  but
tried  mightily  to  assimilate  by  converting,  getting  baptized,  and  adopting
the  dress,  manner,  and  even  pince-nez  glasses  of  a  proper  Prussian.  The
director of the chemistry institute where Einstein had his office, he had been
mediating  the  war  between  Einstein  and  Mari   just  as  the  larger  war  in
Europe was breaking out. Although he hoped for a commission as an officer
in the army, because he was an academic of Jewish heritage he had to settle
for being made a sergeant.43

Haber  reorganized  his  institute  to  develop  chemical  weapons  for
Germany.  He  had  already  found  a  way  to  synthesize  ammonia  from
nitrogen,  which  permitted  the  Germans  to  mass-produce  explosives.  He
then turned his attention to making deadly chlorine gas, which, heavier than
air, would flow down into the trenches and painfully asphyxiate soldiers by
burning  through  their  throats  and  lungs.  In  April  1915,  modern  chemical
warfare was inaugurated when some five thousand French and Belgians met
that deadly fate at Ypres, with Haber personally supervising the attack. (In
an irony that may have been lost on the inventor of dynamite, who endowed

the  prize,  Haber  won  the  1918  Nobel  in  chemistry  for  his  process  of
synthesizing ammonia.)

His colleague and occasional academic rival Nernst, bespectacled and 50,
had his wife inspect his style as he practiced marching and saluting in front
of their house. Then he took his private car and showed up at the western
front  to  be  a  volunteer  driver.  Upon  his  return  to  Berlin,  he  experimented
with tear gas and other irritants that could be used as a humane way to flush
the enemy out of the trenches, but the generals decided they preferred the
lethal approach that Haber was taking, so Nernst became part of that effort.
Even the revered Planck supported what he called Germany�s �just war.�
As he told his students when they went off to battle, �Germany has drawn
its sword against the breeding ground of insidious perfidy.�44

Einstein was able to avoid letting the war cause a personal rift between
him  and  his  three  colleagues,  and  he  spent  the  spring  of  1915  tutoring
Haber�s  son  in  math.45  But  when  they  signed  a  petition  defending
Germany�s militarism, he felt compelled to break with them politically.

The  petition,  published  in  October  1914,  was  titled  �Appeal  to  the
Cultured World� and became known as the �Manifesto of the 93,� after the
number of intellectuals who endorsed it. With scant regard for the truth, it
denied  that  the  German  army  had  committed  any  attacks  on  civilians  in
Belgium and went on to proclaim that the war was necessary. �Were it not
for German militarism, German culture would have been wiped off the face
of  the  earth,�  it  asserted.  �We  shall  wage  this  fight  to  the  very  end  as  a
cultured  nation,  a  nation  that  holds  the  legacy  of  Goethe,  Beethoven,  and
Kant no less sacred than hearth and home.�46

It  was  no  surprise  that  among  the  scientists  who  signed  was  the
conservative Philipp Lenard, of photoelectric effect fame, who would later
become  a  rabid  anti-Semite  and  Einstein  hater.  What  was  distressing  was
that Haber, Nernst, and Planck also signed. As both citizens and scientists,
they  had  a  natural  instinct  to  go  along  with  the  sentiments  of  others.
Einstein, on the other hand, often displayed a natural inclination not to go
along,  which  sometimes  was  an  advantage  both  as  a  scientist  and  as  a
citizen.

A  charismatic  adventurer  and  occasional  physician  named  Georg
Friedrich  Nicolai,  who  had  been  born  Jewish  (his  original  name  was
Lewinstein)  and  was  a  friend  of  both  Elsa  and  her  daughter  Ilse,  worked
with Einstein to write a pacifist response. Their �Manifesto to Europeans�

appealed for a culture that transcended nationalism and attacked the authors
of  the  original  manifesto.  �They  have  spoken  in  a  hostile  spirit,�  Einstein
and Nicolai wrote. �Nationalist passions cannot excuse this attitude, which
is unworthy of what the world has heretofore called culture.�

Einstein suggested to Nicolai that Max Planck, even though he had been
one of the signers of the original manifesto, might also want to participate
in their countermanifesto because of his �broad-mindedness and good will.�
He also gave Zangger�s name as a possibility. But neither man, apparently,
was  willing  to  get  involved.  In  an  indication  of  the  temper  of  the  times,
Einstein and Nicolai were able to garner only two other supporters. So they
dropped their effort, and it was not published at the time.47

Einstein  also  became  an  early  member  of  the  liberal  and  cautiously
pacifist New Fatherland League, a club that pushed for an early peace and
the establishment of a federal structure in Europe to avoid future conflicts.
It  published  a  pamphlet  titled  �The  Creation  of  the  United  States  of
Europe,� and it helped get pacifist literature into prisons and other places.
Elsa went with Einstein to some of the Monday evening meetings until the
group was banned in early 1916.48

One of the most prominent pacifists during the war was the French writer
Romain Rolland, who had tried to promote friendship between his country
and  Germany.  Einstein  visited  him  in  September  1915  near  Lake  Geneva.
Rolland noted in his diary that Einstein, speaking French laboriously, gave
�an amusing twist to the most serious of subjects.�

As  they  sat  on  a  hotel  terrace  amid  swarms  of  bees  plundering  the
flowering vines, Einstein joked about the faculty meetings in Berlin where
each of the professors would anguish over the topic �why are we Germans
hated  in  the  world�  and  then  would  �carefully  steer  clear  of  the  truth.�
Daringly,  maybe  even  recklessly,  Einstein  openly  said  that  he  thought
Germany could not be reformed and therefore hoped the allies would win,
�which would smash the power of Prussia and the dynasty.�49

The following month, Einstein got into a bitter exchange with Paul Hertz,
a noted mathematician in G�ttingen who was, or had been, a friend. Hertz
was an associate member of the New Fatherland League with Einstein, but
he  had  shied  away  from  becoming  a  full  member  when  it  became
controversial. �This type of cautiousness, not standing up for one�s rights, is
the cause of the entire wretched political situation,� Einstein berated. �You

have  that  type  of  valiant  mentality  the  ruling  powers  love  so  much  in
Germans.�

�Had  you  devoted  as  much  care  to  understanding  people  as  to
understanding science, you would not have written me an insulting letter,�
Hertz  replied.  It  was  a  telling  point,  and  true.  Einstein  was  better  at
fathoming  physical  equations  than  personal  ones,  as  his  family  knew,  and
he admitted so in his apology. �You must forgive me, particularly since�as
you  yourself  rightly  say�I  have  not  bestowed  the  same  care  to
understanding people as to understanding science,� he wrote.50

In November, Einstein published a three-page essay titled �My Opinion
of the War� that skirted the border of what was permissible, even for a great
scientist, to say in Germany. He speculated that there existed �a biologically
determined  feature  of  the  male  character�  that  was  one  of  the  causes  of
wars. When the article was published by the Goethe League that month, a
few  passages  were  deleted  for  safety�s  sake,  including  an  attack  on
patriotism  as  potentially  containing  �the  moral  requisites  of  bestial  hatred
and mass murder.�51

The idea that war had a biological basis in male aggression was a topic
Einstein also explored in a letter to his friend in Zurich, Heinrich Zangger.
�What  drives  people  to  kill  and  maim  each  other  so  savagely?�  Einstein
asked. �I think it is the sexual character of the male that leads to such wild
explosions.�

The only method of containing such aggression, he argued, was a world
organization that had the power to police member nations.52 It was a theme
he would pick up again eighteen years later, in the final throes of his pure
pacifism,  when  he  engaged  in  a  public  exchange  of  letters  with  Sigmund
Freud on both male psychology and the need for world government.

The Home Front, 1915

The  early  months  of  the  war  in  1915  made  Einstein�s  separation  from
Hans  Albert  and  Eduard  more  difficult,  both  emotionally  and  logistically.
They  wanted  him  to  come  visit  them  in  Zurich  for  Easter  that  year,  and
Hans  Albert,  who  was  just  turning  11,  wrote  him  two  letters  designed  to
pull at his heart: �I just think: At Easter you�re going to be here and we�ll
have a Papa again.�

 
In  his  next  postcard,  he  said  that  his  younger  brother  told  him  about
having a dream �that Papa was here.� He also described how well he was
doing  in  math.  �Mama  assigns  me  problems;  we  have  a  little  booklet;  I
could do the same with you as well.�53

The war made it impossible for him to come at Easter, but he responded
to the postcards by promising Hans Albert that he would come in July for a
hiking vacation in the Swiss Alps. �In the summer I will take a trip with just
you alone for a fortnight or three weeks,� he wrote. �This will happen every
year, and Tete [Eduard] may also come along when he is old enough for it.�
Einstein  also  expressed  his  delight  that  his  son  had  taken  a  liking  to
geometry. It had been his �favorite pastime� when he was about the same
age, he said, �but I had no one to demonstrate anything to me, so I had to
learn it from books.� He wanted to be with his son to help teach him math
and  �tell  you  many  fine  and  interesting  things  about  science  and  much
else.�  But  that  would  not  always  be  possible.  Perhaps  they  could  do  it  by
mail?  �If  you  write  me  each  time  what  you  already  know,  I�ll  give  you  a
nice little problem to solve.� He sent along a toy for each of his sons, along
with  an  admonition  to  brush  their  teeth  well.  �I  do  the  same  and  am  very
happy now to have kept enough healthy teeth.�54

But  the  tension  in  the  family  worsened.  Einstein  and  Mari   exchanged
letters  arguing  about  both  money  and  vacation  timing,  and  at  the  end  of
June  a  curt  postcard  came  from  Hans  Albert.  �If  you�re  so  unfriendly  to
her,�  he  said  of  his  mother,  �I  don�t  want  to  go  with  you.�  So  Einstein
canceled his planned trip to Zurich and instead went with Elsa and her two
daughters to the Baltic sea resort of Sellin.

Einstein was convinced that Mari  was turning the children against him.
He  suspected,  probably  correctly,  that  her  hand  was  behind  the  postcards
Hans Albert was sending, both the plaintive ones making him feel guilty for
not being in Zurich and the sharper ones rejecting vacation hikes. �My fine
boy had been alienated from me for a few years already by my wife, who
has  a  vengeful  disposition,�  he  complained  to  Zangger.  �The  postcard  I
received from little Albert had been inspired, if not downright dictated, by
her.�

He asked Zangger, who was a professor of medicine, to check on young
Eduard, who had been suffering ear infections and other ailments. �Please
write  me  what  is  wrong  with  my  little  boy,�  he  pleaded.  �I�m  particularly
fondly attached to him; he was still so sweet to me and innocent.�55

It  was  not  until  the  beginning  of  September  that  he  finally  made  it  to
Switzerland. Mari  felt it would be proper for him to stay with her and the
boys, despite the strain. They were, after all, still married. She had hopes of
reconciling. But Einstein showed no interest in being with her. Instead, he
stayed in a hotel and spent a lot of time with his friends Michele Besso and
Heinrich Zangger.

As  it  turned  out,  he  got  a  chance  to  see  his  sons  only  twice  during  the
entire three weeks he was in Switzerland. In a letter to Elsa, he blamed his
estranged  wife:  �The  cause  was  mother�s  fear  of  the  little  ones  becoming
too dependent on me.� Hans Albert let his father know that the whole visit
made him feel uncomfortable.56

After  Einstein  returned  to  Berlin,  Hans  Albert  paid  a  call  on  Zangger.
The  kindly  medical  professor,  friends  of  all  sides  in  the  dispute,  tried  to
work out an accord so that Einstein could visit his sons. Besso also played
intermediary. Einstein  could  see his  sons, Besso advised  in  a formal  letter
he wrote after consulting with Mari , but not in Berlin nor in the presence
of Elsa�s family. It would be best to do it at �a good Swiss inn,� initially just
with Hans Albert, where they could spend some time on their own free of
all distractions. Over Christmas, Hans Albert was planning to visit Besso�s
family, and he suggested that perhaps Einstein could come then.57

The Race to General Relativity, 1915

What made the flurry of political and personal turmoil in the fall of 1915
so  remarkable  was  that  it  highlighted  Einstein�s  ability  to  concentrate  on,
and  compartmentalize,  his  scientific  endeavors  despite  all  distractions.
During  that  period,  with  great  effort  and  anxiety,  he  was  engaged  in  a
competitive rush to what he later called the greatest accomplishment of his
life.58

Back  when  Einstein  had  moved  to  Berlin  in  the  spring  of  1914,  his
colleagues  had  assumed  that  he  would  set  up  an  institute  and  attract
acolytes to work on the most pressing problem in physics: the implications
of quantum theory. But Einstein was more of a lone wolf. Unlike Planck, he
did not want a coterie of collaborators or prot�g�s, and he preferred to focus

 
on  what  again  had  become  his  personal  passion:  the  generalization  of  his
theory of relativity.59

So after his wife and sons left him for Zurich, Einstein moved out of their
old  apartment  and  rented  one  that  was  nearer  to  Elsa  and  the  center  of
Berlin.  It  was  a  sparsely  furnished  bachelor�s  refuge,  but  still  rather
spacious:  it  had  seven  rooms  on  the  third  floor  of  a  new  five-story
building.60

Einstein�s study at home featured a large wooden writing table that was
cluttered with piles of papers and journals. Padding around this hermitage,
eating and working at whatever hours suited him, sleeping when he had to,
he waged his solitary struggle.

Through  the  spring  and  summer  of  1915,  Einstein  wrestled  with  his
Entwurf theory, refining it and defending it against a variety of challenges.
He began calling it �the general theory� rather than merely �a generalized
theory�  of  relativity,  but  that  did  not  mask  its  problems,  which  he  kept
trying to deflect.

He claimed that his equations had the greatest amount of covariance that
was permissible given his hole argument and other strictures of physics, but
he began to suspect that this was not correct. He also got into an exhausting
debate  with  the  Italian  mathematician  Tullio  Levi-Civita,  who  pointed  out
problems  with  his  handling  of  the  tensor  calculus.  And  there  was  still  the
puzzle  of  the  incorrect  result  the  theory  gave  for  the  shift  in  Mercury�s
orbit.

At least his Entwurf theory still successfully explained�or so he thought
through the summer of 1915�rotation as being a form of relative motion,
that  is,  a  motion  that  could  be  defined  only  relative  to  the  positions  and
motions  of  other  objects.  His  field  equations,  he  thought,  were  invariant
under the transformation to rotating coordinates.61

Einstein was confident enough in his theory to show it off at a weeklong
series  of  two-hour  lectures,  starting  at  the  end  of  June  1915,  at  the
University  of  G�ttingen,  which  had  become  the  preeminent  center  for  the
mathematical  side  of  theoretical  physics.  Foremost  among  the  geniuses
there was David Hilbert, and Einstein was particularly eager�too eager, it
would turn out�to explain all the intricacies of relativity to him.

The visit to G�ttingen was a triumph. Einstein exulted to Zangger that he
had  �the  pleasurable  experience  of  convincing  the  mathematicians  there
thoroughly.� Of Hilbert, a fellow pacifist, he added, �I met him and became

quite fond of him.� A few weeks later, after again reporting, �I was able to
convince Hilbert of the general theory of relativity,� Einstein called him �a
man  of  astonishing  energy  and  independence.�  In  a  letter  to  another
physicist,  Einstein  was  even  more  effusive:  �In  G�ttingen  I  had  the  great
pleasure of seeing that everything was understood down to the details. I am
quite enchanted with Hilbert!�62

Hilbert was likewise enchanted with Einstein and his theory. So much so
that he soon set out to see if he could beat Einstein to the goal of getting the
field  equations  right.  Within  three  months  of  his  G�ttingen  lectures,
Einstein was confronted with two distressing discoveries: that his Entwurf
theory was indeed flawed, and that Hilbert was racing feverishly to come up
with the correct formulations on his own.

Einstein�s realization that his Entwurf theory was unraveling came from
an  accumulation  of  problems.  But  it  culminated  with  two  major  blows  in
early October 1915.

The  first  was  that,  upon  rechecking,  Einstein  found  that  the  Entwurf
equations  did  not  actually  account  for  rotation  as  he  had  thought.63  He
hoped to prove that rotation could be conceived of as just another form of
relative motion, but it turned out that the Entwurf didn�t actually prove this.
The  Entwurf  equations  were  not,  as  he  had  believed,  covariant  under  a
transformation that uniformly rotated the coordinate axes.

Besso  had  warned  him  in  a  memo  in  1913  that  this  seemed  to  be  a
problem. But Einstein had ignored him. Now, upon redoing his calculations,
he  was  dismayed  to  see  this  pillar  knocked  away.  �This  is  a  blatant
contradiction,� he lamented to the astronomer Freundlich.

He  assumed  that  the  same  mistake  also  accounted  for  his  theory�s
inability to account fully for the shift in Mercury�s orbit. And he despaired
that he would not be able to find the problem. �I do not believe I am able to
find  the  mistake  myself,  for  in  this  matter  my  mind  is  too  set  in  a  deep
rut.�64

In addition, he realized that he had made a mistake in what was called his
�uniqueness�  argument:  that  the  sets  of  conditions  required  by  energy-
momentum conservation and other physical restrictions uniquely led to the
field  equations  in  the  Entwurf.  He  wrote  Lorentz  explaining  in  detail  his
previous �erroneous assertions.�65

Added to these problems were ones he already knew about: the Entwurf
equations  were  not  generally  covariant,  meaning  that  they  did  not  really

make all forms of accelerated and nonuniform motion relative, and they did
not fully explain Mercury�s anomalous orbit. And now, as this edifice was
crumbling, he could hear what seemed to be Hilbert�s footsteps gaining on
him from G�ttingen.

Part of Einstein�s genius was his tenacity. He could cling to a set of ideas,
even  in  the  face  of  �apparent  contradiction�  (as  he  put  it  in  his  1905
relativity  paper).  He  also  had  a  deep  faith  in  his  intuitive  feel  for  the
physical  world.  Working  in  a  more  solitary  manner  than  most  other
scientists, he held true to his own instincts, despite the qualms of others.

But although he was tenacious, he was not mindlessly stubborn. When he
finally  decided  his  Entwurf  approach  was  untenable,  he  was  willing  to
abandon it abruptly. That is what he did in October 1915.

To replace his doomed Entwurf theory, Einstein shifted his focus from the
physical strategy, which emphasized his feel for basic principles of physics,
and returned to a greater reliance on a mathematical strategy, which made
use of the Riemann and Ricci tensors. It was an approach he had used in his
Zurich notebooks and then abandoned, but on returning to it he found that it
could  provide  a  way  to  generate  generally  covariant  gravitational  field
equations. �Einstein�s reversal,� writes John Norton, �parted the waters and
led him from bondage into the promised land of general relativity.�66

Of course, as always, his approach remained a mix of both strategies. To
pursue  a  revitalized  mathematical  strategy,  he  had  to  revise  the  physical
postulates  that  were  the  foundation  for  his  Entwurf  theory.  �This  was
exactly the sort of convergence of physical and mathematical considerations
that eluded Einstein in the Zurich notebook and in his work on the Entwurf
theory,� write Michel Janssen and J�rgen Renn.67

Thus he returned to the tensor analysis that he had used in Zurich, with
its greater emphasis on the mathematical goal of finding equations that were
generally  covariant.  �Once  every  last  bit  of  confidence  in  the  earlier
theories  had  given  way,�  he  told  a  friend,  �I  saw  clearly  that  it  was  only
through  general  covariance  theory,  i.e.,  with  Riemann�s  covariant,  that  a
satisfactory solution could be found.�68

The  result  was  an  exhausting,  four-week  frenzy  during  which  Einstein
wrestled  with  a  succession  of  tensors,  equations,  corrections,  and  updates
that  he  rushed  to  the  Prussian  Academy  in  a  flurry  of  four  Thursday
lectures. It climaxed, with the triumphant revision of Newton�s universe, at
the end of November 1915.

Every week, the fifty or so members of the Prussian Academy gathered
in  the  grand  hall  of  the  Prussian  State  Library  in  the  heart  of  Berlin  to
address each other as �Your Excellency� and listen to fellow members pour
forth  their  wisdom.  Einstein�s  series  of  four  lectures  had  been  scheduled
weeks earlier, but until they began�and even after they had begun�he was
still working furiously on his revised theory.

The  first  was  delivered  on  November  4.  �For  the  last  four  years,�  he
began,  �I  have  tried  to  establish  a  general  theory  of  relativity  on  the
assumption of the relativity even of non-uniform motion.� Referring to his
discarded Entwurf theory, he said he �actually believed I had discovered the
only law of gravitation� that conformed to physical realities.

But  then,  with  great  candor,  he  detailed  all  of  the  problems  that  theory
had  encountered.  �For  that  reason,  I  completely  lost  trust  in  the  field
equations� that he had been defending for more than two years. Instead, he
said,  he  had  now  returned  to  the  approach  that  he  and  his  mathematical
caddy,  Marcel  Grossmann,  had  been  using  in  1912.  �Thus  I  went  back  to
the requirement of a more general covariance of the field equations, which I
had  left  only  with  a  heavy  heart  when  I  worked  together  with  my  friend
Grossmann. In fact, we had then already come quite close to the solution.�

Einstein reached back to the Riemann and Ricci tensors that Grossmann
had introduced him to in 1912. �Hardly anyone who truly understands it can
resist the charm of this theory,� he lectured. �It signifies a real triumph of
the method of the calculus founded by Gauss, Riemann, Christoffel, Ricci,
and Levi-Civita.�69

This  method  got  him  much  closer  to  the  correct  solution,  but  his
equations  on  November  4  were  still  not  generally  covariant.  That  would
take another three weeks.

Einstein  was  in  the  throes  of  one  of  the  most  concentrated  frenzies  of
scientific  creativity  in  history.  He  was  working,  he  said,  �horrendously
intensely.�70  In  the  midst  of  this  ordeal,  he  was  also  still  dealing  with  the
personal  crisis  within  his  family.  Letters  arrived  from  both  his  wife  and
Michele Besso, who was acting on her behalf, that pressed the issue of his
financial  obligations  and  discussed  the  guidelines  for  his  contact  with  his
sons.

On  the  very  day  he  turned  in  his  first  paper,  November  4,  he  wrote  an
anguished�and  painfully  poignant�letter  to  Hans  Albert,  who  was  in
Switzerland:

I will try to be with you for a month every year so that you will have a
father  who  is  close  to  you  and  can  love  you.  You  can  learn  a  lot  of
good things from me that no one else can offer you. The things I have
gained  from  so  much  strenuous  work  should  be  of  value  not  only  to
strangers  but  especially  to  my  own  boys.  In  the  last  few  days  I
completed  one  of  the  finest  papers  of  my  life.  When  you  are  older,  I
will tell you about it.

He  ended  with  a  small  apology  for  seeming  so  distracted:  �I  am  often  so
engrossed in my work that I forget to eat lunch.�71

Einstein  also  took  time  off  from  furiously  revising  his  equations  to
engage  in  an  awkward  fandango  with  his  erstwhile  friend  and  competitor
David  Hilbert,  who  was  racing  him  to  find  the  equations  of  general
relativity. Einstein had been informed that the G�ttingen mathematician had
figured  out  the  flaws  in  the  Entwurf  equations.  Worried  about  being
scooped, he wrote Hilbert a letter saying that he himself had discovered the
flaws  four  weeks  earlier,  and  he  sent  along  a  copy  of  his  November  4
lecture.  �I  am  curious  whether  you  will  take  kindly  to  this  new  solution,�
Einstein asked with a touch of defensiveness.72

Hilbert  was  not  only  a  better  pure  mathematician  than  Einstein,  he  also
had  the  advantage  of  not  being  as  good  a  physicist.  He  did  not  get  all
wrapped  up,  the  way  Einstein  did,  in  making  sure  that  any  new  theory
conformed to Newton�s old one in a weak static field or that it obeyed the
laws  of  causality.  Instead  of  a  dual  math-and-physics  strategy,  Hilbert
pursued mainly a math strategy, focusing on finding the equations that were
covariant. �Hilbert liked to joke that physics was too complicated to be left
to the physicists,� notes Dennis Overbye.73

Einstein  presented  his  second  paper  the  following  Thursday,  November
11. In it, he used the  Ricci tensor and imposed  new  coordinate  conditions
that allowed the equations thus to be generally covariant. As it turned out,
that  did  not  greatly  improve  matters.  Einstein  was  still  close  to  the  final
answer, but making little headway.74

Once again, he sent the paper off to Hilbert. �If my present modification
(which does not  change the  equations)  is  legitimate, then  gravitation must
play  a fundamental  role in  the  composition  of matter,� Einstein  said.  �My
own curiosity is interfering with my work!�75

 
The reply that Hilbert sent the next day must have unnerved Einstein. He
said he was about ready to oblige with �an axiomatic solution to your great
problem.�  He  had  planned  to  hold  off  discussing  it  until  he  explored  the
physical ramifications further. �But since you are so interested, I would like
to lay out my theory in very complete detail this coming Tuesday,� which
was November 16.

He invited Einstein to come to G�ttingen and have the dubious pleasure
of personally hearing him lay out the answer. The meeting would begin at 6
p.m.,  and  Hilbert  helpfully  provided  Einstein  with  the  arrival  times  of  the
two afternoon trains from Berlin. �My wife and I would be very pleased if
you stayed with us.�

Then,  after  signing  his  name,  Hilbert  felt  compelled  to  add  what  must
surely  have  been  a  tantalizing  and  disconcerting  postscript.  �As  far  as  I
understand  your  new  paper,  the  solution  given  by  you  is  entirely  different
from mine.�

Einstein  wrote  four  letters  on  November  15,  a  Monday,  that  give  a
glimpse into why he was suffering stomach pains. To his son Hans Albert,
he suggested that he would like to travel to Switzerland around Christmas
and  New  Year�s  to  visit  him.  �Maybe  it  would  be  better  if  we  were  alone
somewhere,� such as at a secluded inn, he suggested to his son. �What do
you think?�

He also wrote his estranged wife a conciliatory letter that thanked her for
her  willingness  not  �to  undermine  my  relations  with  the  boys.�  And  he
reported  to  their  mutual  friend  Zangger,  �I  have  modified  the  theory  of
gravity, having realized that my earlier proofs had a gap ...I shall be glad to
come to Switzerland at the turn of the year in order to see my dear boy.�76

Finally, he replied to Hilbert and declined his invitation to visit G�ttingen
the next day. His letter did not hide his anxiety: �Your analysis interests me
tremendously . . . The hints you gave in your messages awaken the greatest
of expectations. Nevertheless, I must refrain from traveling to G�ttingen for
the moment ...I am tired out and plagued by stomach pains . . . If possible,
please  send  me  a  correction  proof  of  your  study  to  mitigate  my
impatience.�77

Fortunately for Einstein, his anxiety was partly alleviated that week by a
joyous  discovery.  Even  though  he  knew  his  equations  were  not  in  final
form,  he  decided  to  see  whether  the  new  approach  he  was  taking  would
yield  the  correct  results  for  what  was  known  about  the  shift  in  Mercury�s

orbit.  Because  he  and  Besso  had  done  the  calculations  once  before  (and
gotten  a  disappointing  result),  it  did  not  take  him  long  to  redo  the
calculations using his revised theory.

The  answer,  which  he  triumphantly  announced  in  the  third  of  his  four
November  lectures,  came  out  right:  43  arc-seconds  per  century.78  �This
discovery  was,  I  believe,  by  far  the  strongest  emotional  experience  in
Einstein�s scientific life, perhaps in all his life,� Abraham Pais later said. He
was  so  thrilled  he  had  heart  palpitations,  as  if  �something  had  snapped�
inside. �I was beside myself with joyous excitement,� he told Ehrenfest. To
another  physicist  he  exulted:  �The  results  of  Mercury�s  perihelion
movement fills me with great satisfaction. How helpful to us is astronomy�s
pedantic accuracy, which I used to secretly ridicule!�79

In the same lecture, he also reported on another calculation he had made.
When  he  first  began  formulating  general  relativity  eight  years  earlier,  he
had  said  that  one  implication  was  that  gravity  would  bend  light.  He  had
previously figured that the bending of light by the gravitational field next to
the  sun  would  be  approximately  0.83  arc-second,  which  corresponded  to
what would be predicted by Newton�s theory when light was treated as if a
particle.  But  now,  using  his  newly  revised  theory,  Einstein  calculated  that
the  bending  of  light  by  gravity  would  be  twice  as  great,  because  of  the
effect produced by the curvature of spacetime. Therefore, the sun�s gravity
would  bend  a  beam  by  about  1.7  arc-seconds,  he  now  predicted.  It  was  a
prediction that would have to wait for the next suitable eclipse, more than
three years away, to be tested.

That very morning, November 18, Einstein received Hilbert�s new paper,
the  one  that  he  had  been  invited  to  G�ttingen  to  hear  presented.  Einstein
was  surprised,  and  somewhat  dismayed,  to  see  how  similar  it  was  to  his
own  work.  His  response  to  Hilbert  was  terse,  a  bit  cold,  and  clearly
designed to assert the priority of his own work:

The system you furnish agrees�as far as I can see�exactly with what
I found in the last few weeks and have presented to the Academy. The
difficulty was not in finding generally covariant equations ...for this is
easily  achieved  with  Riemann�s  tensor  .  .  .  Three  years  ago  with  my
friend  Grossmann  I  had  already  taken  into  consideration  the  only
covariant  equations,  which  have  now  been  shown  to  be  the  correct
ones.  We  had  distanced  ourselves  from  it,  reluctantly,  because  it

seemed to me that the physical discussion yielded an incongruity with
Newton�s law. Today I am presenting to the Academy a paper in which
I  derive  quantitatively  out  of  general  relativity,  without  any  guiding
hypothesis, the perihelion motion of Mercury. No gravitational theory
has achieved this until now.80

Hilbert  responded  kindly  and  quite  generously  the  following  day,
claiming  no  priority  for  himself.  �Cordial  congratulations  on  conquering
perihelion motion,� he wrote. �If I could calculate as rapidly as you, in my
equations  the  electron  would  have  to  capitulate  and  the  hydrogen  atom
would have to produce its note of apology about why it does not radiate.�81
Yet the day after, on November 20, Hilbert sent in a paper to a G�ttingen
science  journal  proclaiming  his  own  version  of  the  equations  for  general
relativity.  The  title  he  picked  for  his  piece  was  not  a  modest  one.  �The
Foundations of Physics,� he called it.

It is not clear how carefully Einstein read the paper that Hilbert sent him
or  what  in  it,  if  anything,  affected  his  thinking  as  he  busily  prepared  his
climactic  fourth  lecture  at  the  Prussian  Academy.  Whatever  the  case,  the
calculations  he  had  done  the  week  earlier,  on  Mercury  and  on  light
deflection,  helped  him  realize  that  he  could  avoid  the  constraints  and
coordinate  conditions  he  had  been  imposing  on  his  gravitational  field
equations.  And  thus  he  produced  in  time  for  his  final  lecture��The  Field
Equations  of  Gravitation,�  on  November  25,  1915�a  set  of  covariant
equations that capped his general theory of relativity.

The  result  was  not  nearly  as  vivid  to  the  layman  as,  say,  E=mc2.  Yet
using the condensed notations of tensors, in which sprawling complexities
can be compressed into little subscripts, the crux of the final Einstein field
equations is compact enough to be emblazoned, as it indeed often has been,
on  T-shirts  designed  for  proud  physics  students.  In  one  of  its  many
variations,82 it can be written as:

The left side of the equation starts with the term Rmn, which is the Ricci
tensor  he  had  embraced  earlier.  The  term  gmn  is  the  all-important  metric
tensor, and the term R is the trace of the Ricci tensor called the Ricci scalar.
Together, this left side of the equation�which is now known as the Einstein

 
 
tensor  and  can  be  written  simply  as  Gmn�compresses  together  all  of  the
information about how the geometry of spacetime is warped and curved by
objects.

The right side describes the movement of matter in the gravitational field.
The  interplay  between  the  two  sides  shows  how  objects  curve  spacetime
and  how,  in  turn,  this  curvature  affects  the  motion  of  objects.  As  the
physicist  John  Wheeler  has  put  it,  �Matter  tells  space-time  how  to  curve,
and curved space tells matter how to move.�83

Thus  is  staged  a  cosmic  tango,  as  captured  by  another  physicist,  Brian

Greene:

Space  and  time  become  players  in  the  evolving  cosmos.  They  come
alive.  Matter  here  causes  space  to  warp  there,  which  causes  matter
over  here  to  move,  which  causes  space  way  over  there  to  warp  even
more,  and  so  on.  General  relativity  provides  the  choreography  for  an
entwined cosmic dance of space, time, matter, and energy.84

At last Einstein had equations that were truly covariant and thus a theory
that incorporated, at least to his satisfaction, all forms of motion, whether it
be  inertial,  accelerated,  rotational,  or  arbitrary.  As  he  proclaimed  in  the
formal presentation of his theory that he published the following March in
the Annalen der Physik, �The general laws of nature are to be expressed by
equations  that  hold  true  for  all  systems  of  coordinates,  that  is  they  are
covariant with respect to any substitutions whatever.�85

Einstein was thrilled by his success, but at the same time he was worried
that  Hilbert,  who  had  presented  his  own  version  five  days  earlier  in
G�ttingen, would be accorded some of the credit for the theory. �Only one
colleague has really understood it,� he wrote to his friend Heinrich Zangger,
�and he is  seeking  to  nostrify  it (Abraham�s expression)  in  a clever way.�
The  expression  �to  nostrify�  (nostrifizieren),  which  had  been  used  by  the
G�ttingen-trained  mathematical  physicist  Max  Abraham,  referred  to  the
practice  of  nostrification  by  which  German  universities  converted  degrees
granted  by  other  universities  into  degrees  of  their  own.  �In  my  personal
experience  I  have  hardly  come  to  know  the  wretchedness  of  mankind
better.� In a letter to Besso a few days later, he added, �My colleagues are
acting hideously in this affair. You will have a good laugh when I tell you
about it.�86

 
So  who  actually  deserves  the  primary  credit  for  the  final  mathematical
equations?  The  Einstein-Hilbert  priority  issue  has  generated  a  small  but
intense  historical  debate,  some  of  which  seems  at  times  to  be  driven  by
passions  that  go  beyond  mere  scientific  curiosity.  Hilbert  presented  a
version  of  his  equations  in  his  talk  on  November  16  and  a  paper  that  he
dated  November  20,  before  Einstein  presented  his  final  equations  on
November 25. However, a team of Einstein scholars in 1997 found a set of
proof pages of Hilbert�s article, on which Hilbert had made revisions that he
then  sent  back  to  the  publisher  on  December  16.  In  the  original  version,
Hilbert�s  equations  differed  in  a  small  but  important  way  from  Einstein�s
final version of the November 25 lecture. They were not actually generally
covariant, and he did not include a step that involved contracting the Ricci
tensor  and  putting  the  resulting  trace  term,  the  Ricci  scalar,  into  the
equation. Einstein did this in his November 25 lecture. Apparently, Hilbert
made  a  correction  in  the  revised  version  of  his  article  to  match  Einstein�s
version.  His  revisions,  quite  generously,  also  added  the  phrase  �first
introduced by Einstein� when he referred to the gravitational potentials.

Hilbert�s advocates (and Einstein�s detractors) respond with a variety of
arguments, including that the page proofs are missing one part and that the
trace term at issue was either unnecessary or obvious.

It  is  fair  to  say  that  both  men�to  some  extent  independently  but  each
also  with  knowledge  of  what  the  other  was  doing�derived  by  November
1915  mathematical  equations  that  gave  formal  expression  to  the  general
theory.  Judging  from  Hilbert�s  revisions  to  his  own  page  proofs,  Einstein
seems  to  have  published  the  final  version  of  these  equations  first.  And  in
the end, even Hilbert gave Einstein credit and priority.

Either  way,  it  was,  without  question,  Einstein�s  theory  that  was  being
formalized by these equations, one that he had explained to Hilbert during
their  time  together  in  G�ttingen  that  summer.  Even  the  physicist  Kip
Thorne, one of those who give Hilbert credit for producing the correct field
equations,  nonetheless  says  that  Einstein  deserves  credit  for  the  theory
underlying  the  equations.  �Hilbert  carried  out  the  last  few  mathematical
steps  to  its  discovery  independently  and  almost  simultaneously  with
Einstein,  but  Einstein  was  responsible  for  essentially  everything  that
preceded  these  steps,�  Thorne  notes.  �Without  Einstein,  the  general
relativistic  laws  of  gravity  might  not  have  been  discovered  until  several
decades later.�87

Hilbert,  graciously,  felt  the  same  way.  As  he  stated  clearly  in  the  final
published  version  of  his  paper,  �The  differential  equations  of  gravitation
that result are, as it seems to me, in agreement with the magnificent theory
of general relativity established by Einstein.� Henceforth he would always
acknowledge  (thus  undermining  those  who  would  use  him  to  diminish
Einstein)  that  Einstein  was  the  sole  author  of  the  theory  of  relativity.88
�Every  boy  in  the  streets  of  G�ttingen  understands  more  about  four-
dimensional  geometry  than  Einstein,�  he  reportedly  said.  �Yet,  in  spite  of
that, Einstein did the work and not the mathematicians.�89

Indeed,  Einstein  and  Hilbert  were  soon  friendly  again.  Hilbert  wrote  in
December, just weeks after their dash for the field equations was finished,
to  say  that  with  his  support  Einstein  had  been  elected  to  the  G�ttingen
Academy. After expressing his thanks, Einstein added, �I feel compelled to
say something else to you.� He explained:

There has been a certain ill-feeling between us, the cause of which I do
not want to analyze. I have struggled against the feeling of bitterness
attached  to  it,  with  complete  success.  I  think  of  you  again  with
unmixed  geniality  and  ask  you  to  try  to  do  the  same  with  me.  It  is  a
shame  when  two  real  fellows  who  have  extricated  themselves
somewhat  from  this  shabby  world  do  not  afford  each  other  mutual
pleasure.90

They resumed their regular correspondence, shared ideas, and plotted to
get  a  job  for  the  astronomer  Freundlich.  By  February  Einstein  was  even
visiting G�ttingen again and staying at Hilbert�s home.

Einstein�s  pride  of  authorship  was  understandable.  As  soon  as  he  got
printed copies of his four lectures, he mailed them out to friends. �Be sure
you  take  a  good  look  at  them,�  he  told  one.  �They  are  the  most  valuable
discovery of my life.� To another he noted, �The theory is of incomparable
beauty.�91

Einstein, at age 36, had produced one of history�s most imaginative and
dramatic revisions of our concepts about the universe. The general theory of
relativity was not merely the interpretation of some experimental data or the
discovery  of  a  more  accurate  set  of  laws.  It  was  a  whole  new  way  of
regarding reality.

 
Newton  had  bequeathed  to  Einstein  a  universe  in  which  time  had  an
absolute  existence  that  tick-tocked  along  independent  of  objects  and
observers, and in which space likewise had an absolute existence. Gravity
was  thought  to  be  a  force  that  masses  exerted  on  one  another  rather
mysteriously  across  empty  space.  Within  this  framework,  objects  obeyed
mechanical laws that had proved remarkably accurate�almost perfect�in
explaining  everything  from  the  orbits  of  the  planets,  to  the  diffusion  of
gases, to the jiggling of molecules, to the propagation of sound (though not
light) waves.

With  his  special  theory  of  relativity,  Einstein  had  shown  that  space  and
time  did  not  have  independent  existences,  but  instead  formed  a  fabric  of
spacetime.  Now,  with  his  general  version  of  the  theory,  this  fabric  of
spacetime became not merely a container for objects and events. Instead, it
had  its  own  dynamics  that  were  determined  by,  and  in  turn  helped  to
determine, the motion of objects within it�just as the fabric of a trampoline
will curve and ripple as a bowling ball and some billiard balls roll across it,
and in turn the dynamic curving and rippling of the trampoline fabric will
determine the path of the rolling balls and cause the billiard balls to move
toward the bowling ball.

The  curving  and  rippling  fabric  of  spacetime  explained  gravity,  its
equivalence to acceleration, and, Einstein asserted, the general relativity of
all  forms  of  motion.92  In  the  opinion  of  Paul  Dirac,  the  Nobel  laureate
pioneer  of  quantum  mechanics,  it  was  �probably  the  greatest  scientific
discovery  ever  made.�  Another  of  the  great  giants  of  twentieth-century
physics,  Max  Born,  called  it  �the  greatest  feat  of  human  thinking  about
nature,  the  most  amazing  combination  of  philosophical  penetration,
physical intuition and mathematical skill.�93

The  entire  process  had  exhausted  Einstein  but  left  him  elated.  His
marriage had collapsed and war was ravaging Europe, but Einstein was as
happy as he would ever be. �My boldest dreams have now come true,� he
exulted  to  Besso.  �General  covariance.  Mercury�s  perihelion  motion
wonderfully precise.� He signed himself �contented but kaput.�94

CHAPTER TEN
DIVORCE
1916�1919

With Elsa, June 1922

�The Narrow Whirlpool of Personal Experience�

As a young man, Einstein had predicted, in a letter to the mother of his
first  girlfriend,  that  the  joys  of  science  would  be  a  refuge  from  painful
personal  emotions.  And  thus  it  was.  His  conquest  of  general  relativity
proved  easier  than  finding  the  formulas  for  the  forces  swirling  within  his
family.

Those  forces  were  complex.  At  the  very  moment  he  was  finalizing  his
field  equations�the  last  week  of  November  1915�his  son  Hans  Albert

 
 
 
 
was  telling  Michele  Besso  that  he  wanted  to  spend  time  alone  with  his
father  over  Christmas,  preferably  on  Zugerberg  mountain  or  someplace
similarly  isolated.  But  simultaneously,  the  boy  was  writing  his  father  a
nasty letter saying he did not want him to come to Switzerland at all.1

How to explain the contradiction? Hans Albert�s mind seemed at times to
display  a  duality�he  was,  after  all,  only  11�and  he  had  powerfully
conflicted  attitudes  toward  his  father.  That  was  no  surprise.  Einstein  was
intense  and  compelling  and  at  times  charismatic.  He  was  also  aloof  and
distracted and had distanced himself, physically and emotionally, from the
boy, who was guarded by a doting mother who felt humiliated.

The  stubborn  patience  that  Einstein  displayed  when  dealing  with
scientific  problems  was  equaled  by  his  impatience  when  dealing  with
personal entanglements. So he informed the boy he was canceling the trip.
�The unkind tone of your letter dismays me very much,� Einstein wrote just
days after finishing his last lecture on general relativity. �I see that my visit
would  bring  you  little  joy,  therefore  I  think  it�s  wrong  to  sit  in  a  train  for
two hours and 20 minutes.�

There  was  also  the  question  of  a  Christmas  present.  Hans  Albert  had
become an avid little skier, and Mari  gave him a set of equipment that cost
70  francs.  �Mama  bought  them  for  me  on  condition  that  you  also
contribute,� he wrote. �I consider them a Christmas present.� This did not
please Einstein. He replied that he would send him a gift in cash, �but I do
think  that  a  luxury  gift  costing  70  francs  does  not  match  our  modest
circumstances,� Einstein wrote, underlining the phrase.2

Besso  put  on  what  he  called  his  �pastoral  manner�  to  mediate.  �You
should  not  take  serious  offense  at  the  boy,�  he  said.  The  source  of  the
friction was Mari , Besso believed, but he asked Einstein to remember that
she was composed �not only of meanness but of goodness.� He should try
to understand, Besso urged, how difficult it was for Mari  to deal with him.
�The  role  as  the  wife  of  a  genius  is  never  easy.�3  In  the  case  of  Einstein,
that was certainly true.

The  anxiety  surrounding  Einstein�s  proposed  visit  was  partly  due  to  a
misunderstanding. Einstein had assumed that the plan to have him and his
son meet at the Bessos� had been arranged because Mari  and Hans Albert
wanted it that way. Instead, the boy had no desire to be a bystander while
his  father  and  Besso  discussed  physics.  Just  the  opposite:  he  wanted  his
father to himself.

Mari   ended  up  writing  to  clear  up  the  matter,  which  Einstein
appreciated. �I was likewise a bit disappointed that I would not get Albert
to myself but only under Besso�s protection,� he said.

So Einstein reinstated his plan to visit Zurich, and he promised it would
be one of many such trips to see his son. �[Hans] Albert* is now entering
the age at which I can mean very much to him,� he said. �I want mainly to
teach him to think, judge and appreciate things objectively.� A week later,
in another letter to Mari , he reaffirmed that he was happy to make the trip,
�for  there  is  a  faint  chance  that  I�ll  please  Albert  by  coming.�  He  did,
however,  add  rather  pointedly,  �See  to  it  that  he  receives  me  fairly
cheerfully.  I  am  quite  tired  and  overworked,  and  not  capable  of  enduring
new agitations and disappointments.�4

It  was  not  to  be.  Einstein�s  exhaustion  lingered,  and  the  war  made  the
border  crossing  from  Germany  difficult.  Two  days  before  Christmas  of
1915,  when  he  was  supposed  to  be  departing  for  Switzerland,  Einstein
instead wrote his son a letter. �I have been working so hard in the last few
months that I urgently need a rest during the Christmas holidays,� he said.
�Aside  from  this,  coming  across  the  border  is  very  uncertain  at  present,
since  it  has  been  almost  constantly  closed  recently.  That  is  why  I  must
unfortunately deprive myself of visiting you now.�

Einstein  spent  Christmas  at  home.  That  day,  he  took  out  of  his  satchel
some  of  the  drawings  that  Hans  Albert  had  sent  him  and  wrote  the  boy  a
postcard saying how much they pleased him. He would come for Easter, he
promised,  and  he  expressed  delight  that  his  son  enjoyed  playing  piano.
�Maybe you can practice something to accompany a violin, and then we can
play at Easter when we are together.�5

that  he  had  no  desire 

After he and Mari  separated, Einstein had initially decided not to seek a
divorce.  One  reason  was 
to  marry  Elsa.
Companionship without commitment suited him just fine. �The attempts to
force  me  into  marriage  come  from  my  cousin�s  parents  and  is  mainly
attributable to vanity, though moral prejudice, which is still very much alive
in  the  old  generation,  plays  a  part,�  Einstein  wrote  Zangger  the  day  after
presenting  his  climactic  November  1915  lecture.  �If  I  let  myself  become
trapped,  my  life  would  become  complicated,  and  above  all  it  would
probably be a heavy blow for my boys. Therefore, I must allow myself not
to be moved either by my inclination or by tears, but must remain as I am.�
It was a resolution he repeated to Besso as well.6

Besso  and  Zangger  agreed  that  he  should  not  seek  a  divorce.  �It  is
important that Einstein knows that his truest friends,� Besso wrote Zangger,
�would regard a divorce and subsequent remarriage as a great evil.�7

But  Elsa  and  her  family  kept  pushing.  So  in  February  1916,  Einstein
wrote Mari  to propose�indeed, beg�that she agree to a divorce, �so that
we  can  arrange  the  rest  of  our  lives  independently.�  The  separation
agreement they had worked out with the help of Fritz Haber, he suggested,
could serve as the basis for a divorce. �It will surely be possible to have the
details  settled  to  your  satisfaction,�  he  promised.  His  letter  also  included
instructions  on  how  to  keep  their  boys  from  suffering  from  calcium
deficiency.8

When  Mari   resisted,  Einstein  became  more  insistent.  �For  you  it
involves a mere formality,� he said. �For me, however, it is an imperative
duty.�  He  informed  Mari   that  Elsa  had  two  daughters  whose  reputations
and  chances  of  marriage  were  being  compromised  by  �the  rumors�  that
were circulating about the illicit relationship their mother was having with
Einstein.  �This  weighs  on  me  and  ought  to  be  redressed  by  a  formal
marriage,� he told Mari . �Try to imagine yourself in my position for once.�
As  an  enticement,  he  offered  more  money.  �You  would  gain  from  this
change,� he told Mari . �I wish to do more than I had obligated myself to
before.�  He  would  transfer  6,000  marks  into  a  fund  for  the  children  and
increase her payments to 5,600 marks annually. �By making myself such a
frugal bed of straw, I am proving to you that my boys� well-being is closest
to my heart, above all else in the world.�

In return, he wanted the right to have his sons visit him in Berlin. They
would  not  come  into  contact  with  Elsa,  he  pledged.  He  even  added  a
somewhat surprising promise: he would not be living with Elsa even if they
got married. Instead, he would keep his own apartment. �For I shall never
give  up  the  state  of  living  alone,  which  has  manifested  itself  as  an
indescribable blessing.�

Mari  did not consent to give him the right to have the boys visit him in
Berlin.  But  she  did  tentatively  agree�or  at  least  so  Einstein  thought�to
allow the start of divorce discussions.9

As he had promised Hans Albert, Einstein arrived in Switzerland in early
April  1916  for  a three-week Easter vacation,  moving into a hotel near  the
Zurich train station. Initially, things went very well. The boys came to see
him  and  greeted  him  joyously.  From  his  hotel,  he  sent  Mari   a  note  of
thanks:

My compliments on the good condition of our boys. They are in such
excellent  physical  and  mental  shape  that  I  could  not  have  wished  for
more. And I know that this is for the most part due to the proper up-
bringing  you  provide  them.  I  am  likewise  thankful  that  you  have  not
alienated me from the children. They came to meet me spontaneously
and sweetly.

Mari  sent word that she wanted to see Einstein herself. Her goal was to
be  assured  that  he  truly  wanted  a  divorce  and  was  not  merely  being
pressured by Elsa. Both Besso and Zangger tried to arrange such a meeting,
but Einstein declined. �There would be no point in a conversation between
us  and  it  could  serve  only  to  reopen  old  wounds,�s  he  wrote  in  a  note  to
Mari .10

Einstein  took  Hans  Albert  off  alone,  as  the  boy  wished,  for  what  was
planned  as  a  ten-day  hiking  excursion  in  a  mountain  resort  overlooking
Lake Lucerne. There they were caught in a late-season snowstorm that kept
them  confined  to  the  inn,  which  initially  pleased  them  both.  �We  are
snowed  in  at  Seelisberg  but  are  enjoying  ourselves  immensely,�  Einstein
wrote Elsa. �The boy delights me, especially with his clever questions and
his undemanding way. No discord exists between us.� Unfortunately, soon
the  weather,  and  perhaps  also  their  enforced  togetherness,  became
oppressive, and they returned to Zurich a few days early.11

Back in Zurich, the tensions revived. One morning, Hans Albert came to
visit  his  father  at  the  physics  institute  to  watch  an  experiment.  It  was  a
pleasant enough activity, but as the boy was leaving for lunch, he urged his
father to come by the house and at least pay a courtesy call on Mari .

Einstein  refused.  Hans  Albert,  who  was  just  about  to  turn  12,  became
angry  and  said  he  would  not  come  back  for  the  completion  of  the
experiment  that  afternoon  unless  his  father  relented.  Einstein  would  not.
�That�s  how  it  remained,�  he  reported  to  Elsa  a  week  later,  on  the  day  he
left Zurich. �And I have seen neither of the children since.�12

 
Mari  subsequently went into an emotional and physical melt-down. She
had a series of minor heart incidents in July 1916, accompanied by extreme
anxiety, and her doctors told her to  remain  in  bed. The children  moved  in
with  the  Bessos,  and  then  to  Lausanne,  where  they  stayed  with  Mari �s
friend Helene Savi , who was riding out the war there.

Besso and Zangger tried to get Einstein to come down from Berlin to be
with  his  sons.  But  Einstein  demurred.  �If  I  go  to  Zurich,  my  wife  will
demand to see me,� he wrote Besso. �This I would have to refuse, partly on
an  inalterable  resolve  partly  also  to  spare  her  the  agitation.  Besides,  you
know that the personal relations between the children and me deteriorated
so much during my stay at Easter (after a very promising start) that I doubt
very much whether my presence would be reassuring for them.�

Einstein  assumed  that  his  wife�s  illness  was  largely  psychological  and
even, perhaps, partly faked. �Isn�t it possible that nerves are behind it all?�
he asked Zangger. To Besso, he was more blunt: �I have the suspicion that
the woman is leading both of you kind-hearted men down the garden path.
She  is  not  afraid  to  use  all  means  when  she  wants  to  achieve  something.
You  have  no  idea  of  the  natural  craftiness  of  such  a  woman.�13  Einstein�s
mother agreed. �Mileva was never as sick as you seem to think,� she told
Elsa.14

Einstein asked Besso to keep him informed of the situation and made a
stab  at  scientific  humor  by  saying  that  his  reports  did  not  need  to  have
logical  �continuity�  because  �this  is  permissible  in  the  age  of  quantum
theory.� Besso was not sympathetic; he wrote Einstein a sharp letter saying
Mari �s  condition  was  not  �a  deception�  but  was  instead  caused  by
emotional stress. Besso�s wife, Anna, was even harsher, adding a postscript
to the letter that addressed Einstein with the formal Sie.15

Einstein backed down from his charge that Mari  was faking illness, but
railed that her emotional distress was unwarranted. �She leads a worry-free
life, has her two precious boys with her, lives in a fabulous neighborhood,
does what she likes with her time, and innocently stands by as the guiltless
party,� he wrote Besso.

Einstein was especially stung by the cold postscript, which he mistakenly
thought came from Michele rather than Anna Besso. So he added his own
postscript:  �We  have  understood  each  other  well  for  20  years,�  he  said.
�And  now  I  see  you  developing  a  bitterness  toward  me  for  the  sake  of  a
woman  who  has  nothing  to  do  with  you.  Resist  it!�  Later  that  day  he

realized he had mistaken Anna�s harsh postscript for something her husband
had written, and he quickly sent along another note apologizing to him.16

On  Zangger�s  advice,  Mari   checked  into  a  sanatorium.  Einstein  still
resisted going to Zurich, even though his boys were at home alone with a
maid,  but  he  told  Zangger  he  would  change  his  mind  �if  you  think  it�s
appropriate.�  Zangger  didn�t.  �The  tension  on  both  sides  is  too  great,�
Zangger explained to Besso, who agreed.17

Despite his detached attitude, Einstein loved his sons and would always
take  care  of  them.  Please  let  them  know,  he  instructed  Zangger,  that  he
would take them under his wing if their mother died. �I would raise the two
boys myself,� he said. �They would be taught at home, as far as possible by
me  personally.�  In  various  letters  over  the  next  few  months,  Einstein
described  his  different  ideas  and  fantasies  for  home-schooling  his  sons,
what he would teach, and even the type of walks they would take. He wrote
Hans Albert to assure him that he was �constantly thinking of you both.�18

But Hans Albert was so angry, or hurt, that he had stopped answering his
father�s letters.  �I believe  that his  attitude  toward me  has fallen  below the
the  given
freezing  point,�  Einstein 
circumstances, I would have reacted in the same way.� After three letters to
his  son  went  unanswered  in  three  months,  Einstein  plaintively  wrote  him:
�Don�t you remember your father anymore? Are we never going to see each
other again?�19

to  Besso.  �Under 

lamented 

Finally,  the  boy  replied  by  sending  a  picture  of  a  boat  he  was
constructing  out  of  wood  carvings.  He  also  described  his  mother�s  return
from the sanatorium. �When Mama came home, we had a celebration. I had
practiced a sonata by Mozart, and Tete had learned a song.�20

Einstein did make one concession to the sad situation: he decided to give
up asking Mari  for a divorce, at least for the time being. That seemed to aid
her recovery. �I�ll take care that she doesn�t get any more disturbance from
me,�  he told Besso. �I have abandoned proceeding with  the  divorce. Now
on to scientific matters!�21

Indeed, whenever personal issues began to weigh on him, he took refuge
in his work. It shielded him, allowed him to escape. As he told Helene Savi
,  likely  with  the  intent  that  it  get  back  to  her  friend  Mari ,  he  planned  to
retreat  into  scientific  reflection.  �I  resemble  a  farsighted  man  who  is

charmed by the vast horizon and whom the foreground bothers only when
an opaque object prevents him from taking in the long view.�22

So even as the personal battle was raging, his science provided solace. In
1916,  he  began  writing  again  about  the  quantum.  He  also  wrote  a  formal
exposition  of  his  general  theory  of  relativity,  which  was  far  more
comprehensive,  and  slightly  more  comprehensible,  than  what  had  poured
forth  in  the  weekly  lectures  during  his  race  with  Hilbert  the  previous
November.23

In  addition,  he  produced  an  even  more  understandable  version:  a  book
for  the  lay  reader,  Relativity:  The  Special  and  the  General  Theory,  that
remains  popular  to  this  day.  To  make  sure  that  the  average  person  would
fathom it, he read every page out loud to Elsa�s daughter Margot, pausing
frequently  to  ask  whether  she  indeed  got  it.  �Yes,  Albert,�  she  invariably
replied, even though (as she confided to others) she found the whole thing
totally baffling.24

This  ability  of  science  to  be  used  as  a  refuge  from  painful  personal
emotions  was  a  theme  of  a  talk  he  gave  at  a  celebration  of  Max  Planck�s
sixtieth birthday. Putatively about Planck, it seemed to convey more about
Einstein  himself.  �One  of  the  strongest  motives  that  leads  men  to  art  and
science  is  escape  from  everyday  life  with  its  painful  crudity  and  hopeless
dreariness,� Einstein said. �Such men make this cosmos and its construction
the  pivot  of  their  emotional  life,  in  order  to  find  the  peace  and  security
which they cannot find in the narrow whirlpool of personal experience.�25

The Treaty

In  early  1917,  it  was  Einstein�s  turn  to  fall  ill.  He  came  down  with
stomach pains that he initially thought were caused by cancer. Now that his
mission was complete, death did not frighten him. He told the astronomer
Freundlich  that  he  was  not  worried  about  dying  because  now  he  had
completed his theory of relativity.

Freundlich, on the other hand, did worry about his friend, who was still
only  38.  He  sent  Einstein  to  a  doctor,  who  diagnosed  the  problem  as  a
chronic  stomach  malady,  one  that  was  exacerbated  by  wartime  food

 
shortages. He put him on a four-week diet of rice, macaroni, and zwieback
bread.

These stomach ailments would lay him low for the next four years, then
linger for the rest of his life. He was living alone and having trouble getting
proper  meals.  From  Zurich,  Zangger  sent  packages  to  help  satisfy  the
prescribed  diet,  but  within  two  months  Einstein  had  lost  close  to  fifty
pounds.  Finally,  by  the  summer  of  1917,  Elsa  was  able  to  rent  a  second
apartment in her building, and she moved him in there to be her neighbor,
charge, and companion.26

Elsa took great joy in foraging for the food he found comforting. She was
resourceful  and  wealthy  enough  to  commandeer  the  eggs  and  butter  and
bread  he  liked,  even  though  the  war  made  such  staples  hard  to  come  by.
Every day she cooked for  him, doted  on him, even found him cigars. Her
parents helped as well by having them both over for comforting meals.27

The health of his younger son, Eduard, also was precarious. Once again
he had fevers, and in early 1917 his lungs became inflamed. After receiving
a  pessimistic  medical  prognosis,  Einstein  lamented  to  Besso,  �My  little
boy�s condition depresses me greatly. It is impossible that he will become a
fully  developed  person.  Who  knows  if  it  wouldn�t  be  better  for  him  if  he
could depart before coming to know life properly.�

To Zangger, he ruminated about the �Spartan�s method��leaving sickly
children  out  on  a  mountain  to  die�but  then  said  he  could  not  accept  that
approach. Instead, he promised to pay whatever it took to get Eduard care,
and he told Zangger to send him to whatever treatment facility he thought
best.  �Even  if  you  silently  say  to  yourself  that  every  effort  is  futile,  send
him anyway, so that my wife and my Albert think that something is being
done.�28

That summer, Einstein traveled back to Switzerland to take Eduard to a
sanatorium in the Swiss village of Arosa. His ability to use science to rise
above  personal  travails  was  illustrated  in  a  letter  he  sent  to  his  physicist
friend Paul  Ehrenfest: �The little one is  very sickly  and must go to  Arosa
for a year. My wife is also ailing. Worries and more worries. Nevertheless, I
have  found  a  nice  generalization  of  the  Sommerfeld-Epstein  quantum
law.�29

Hans Albert joined his father on the journey to take Eduard to Arosa, and
he  then  visited  when  Einstein  was  staying  with  his  sister,  Maja,  and  her
husband,  Paul  Winteler,  in  Lucerne.  There  he  found  his  father  bedridden

with stomach pains, but his uncle Paul took him hiking. Gradually, with a
few  rough  patches,  Einstein�s  relationship  with  his  older  son  was  being
restored.  �The  letter  from  my  Albert  was  the  greatest  joy  I�ve  had  for  the
past year,� he told Zangger. �I sense with bliss the intimate tie between us.�
Financial  worries  were  also  easing.  �I  received  a  prize  of  1,500  crowns
from the Viennese Academy, which we can use for Tete�s cure.�30

Now  that  he  had  moved  into  the  same  building  as  Elsa  and  she  was
nursing him back to health, it was inevitable that the issue of a divorce from
Mari  would arise again. In early 1918, it did. �My desire to put my private
affairs in some state of order prompts me to suggest a divorce to you for a
second time,� he wrote. �I am resolved to do everything to make this step
possible.� This time his financial offer was even more generous. He would
pay  her  9,000  marks  rather  than  what  had  now  become  a  6,000  annual
stipend,  with  the  provision  that  2,000  would  go  into  a  fund  for  their
children.*

Then  he  added  an  amazing  new  inducement.  He  was  convinced,  with
good reason, that he would someday win the Nobel Prize. Even though the
scientific community had not yet fully come to grips with special relativity,
much  less  his  new  and  unproven  theory  of  general  relativity,  eventually  it
would.  Or  his  groundbreaking 
the
photoelectric effect would be recognized. And so he made a striking offer to
Mari : �The Nobel Prize�in the event of the divorce and the event that it is
bestowed upon me�would be ceded to you in full.�31

light  quanta  and 

insights 

into 

It  was  a  financially  enticing  wager.  The  Nobel  Prize  was  then,  as  it  is
now,  very  lucrative,  indeed  huge.  In  1918,  it  was  worth  about  135,000
Swedish kronor, or 225,000 German marks�more than 37 times what Mari
  was  getting  annually.  In  addition,  the  German  mark  was  starting  to
collapse,  but  the  Nobel  would  be  paid  in  stable  Swedish  currency.  Most
poignantly, there would be some symbolic justice: she had helped Einstein
with the math and proofreading and domestic support for his 1905 papers,
and now she could reap some of the reward.

At first she was furious. �Exactly two years ago, such letters pushed me
over the brink into misery, which I still can�t get over,� she replied. �Why
do you torment me so endlessly? I really don�t deserve this from you.�32

But within a few days, she began to assess the situation more clinically.
Her  life  had  reached  a  low  point.  She  suffered  pains,  anxieties,  and
depression. Her younger son was in a sanatorium. The sister who had come

to help her succumbed to depression and had been committed to an asylum.
And  her  brother,  who  was  serving  as  a  medic  in  the  Austrian  army,  had
been  captured  by  the  Russians.  Perhaps  an  end  to  the  battles  with  her
husband and the chance of financial security might, in fact, be best for her.
So  she  discussed  the  option  with  her  neighbor  Emil  Z�rcher,  who  was  a
lawyer and a friend.

A few days later she decided to take the deal. �Have your lawyer write
Dr.  Z�rcher  about  how  he  envisions  it,  how  the  contract  should  be,�  she
replied. �I must leave upsetting things to objective persons. I do not want to
stand in the way of your happiness, if you are so resolved.�33

The  negotiations  proceeded  through  letters  and  third  parties  through
April.  �I  am  curious  what  will  last  longer,  the  world  war  or  our  divorce
proceedings,�  he  complained  lightly  at  one  point.  But  as  things  were
progressing the way he wanted, he merrily added, �In comparison, this little
matter of ours is still much the more pleasant. Amiable greetings to you and
kisses to the boys.�

The  main  issue  was  money.  Mari   complained  to  a  friend  that  Einstein
was being stingy (in fact he wasn�t) because of Elsa. �Elsa�s very greedy,�
Mari  charged. �Her two sisters are very rich, and she�s always envious of
them.� Letters went back and forth over exactly how the prospective Nobel
Prize money would be paid, what right the children would have to it, what
would happen to it if she remarried, and even what compensation he would
offer in the unlikely event that the prize was never awarded to him.34

Another contentious issue was whether his sons could visit him in Berlin.
On  barring  that,  Mari   held  firm.35  Finally,  at  the  end  of  April,  he
surrendered this final point. �I�m giving in about the children because I now
believe  you  want  to  handle  matters  in  a  conciliatory  manner,�  he  said.
�Maybe  you  will  later  take  the  view  that  the  boys  can  come  here  without
reservation. For the time being, I will see them in Switzerland.�36

Given Mari �s poor health, Einstein had tried to work out another option
for the two boys: having them live in nearby Lucerne with his sister, Maja,
and her husband, Paul Winteler. The Wintelers were willing to take custody
of their nephews, and they took the train to Bern one day to see if this could
be arranged. But when they arrived, Zangger was away, and they wanted his
help before discussing things with Mari . So Paul went over to see his feisty
sister Anna, who was married to Michele Besso, to see if they could have a
room for the night.

He had planned not to tell Anna the purpose of their mission, as she had a
protective  attitude  toward  Mari   and  a  hair-trigger  sense  of  righteous
indignation. �But she guessed the purpose of our coming,� Maja reported to
Einstein, �and when Paul confirmed her suspicions a torrent of accusations,
scoldings, and threats poured forth.�37

So Einstein wrote a letter to Anna to try to enlist her support. Mari , he
argued,  was  �incapable  of  running  a  household�  given  her  condition.  It
would be best if Hans Albert went to live with Maja and Paul, he argued.
Eduard  could  either  do  the  same  or  stay  in  a  mountain-air  clinic  until  his
health improved. Einstein would pay for it all, including Mari �s costs in a
sanatorium in Lucerne, where she could see her sons every day.

Unfortunately, Einstein made the mistake of ending the letter by pleading
with Anna to help resolve the situation so that he could marry Elsa and end
the shame that their relationship was causing her daughters. �Think of the
two young girls, whose prospects of getting married are being hampered,�
he said. �Do put in a good word for me sometime to Miza [Mari ] and make
it  clear  to  her  how  unkind  it  is  to  complicate  the  lives  of  others
pointlessly.�38

Anna  shot  back  that  Elsa  was  the  one  being  selfish.  �If  Elsa  had  not
wanted to make herself so vulnerable, she should not have run after you so
conspicuously.�39

In  truth,  Anna  was  quite  difficult,  and  she  soon  had  a  falling  out  with
Mari   as  well.  �She  tried  to  meddle  in  my  affairs  in  a  way  that  reveals
potential  human  malice,� Mari   complained  to  Einstein.  At  the  very  least,
this helped improve relations between the Einsteins. �I see from your letter
that  you  also  have  had  problems  with  Anna  Besso,�  he  wrote  Mari   just
after  they  had  agreed  to  the  divorce  terms.  �She  has  written  me  such
impertinent letters that I�ve put an end to further correspondence.�40

It would be a few more months before the divorce decree could become
final,  but  now  that  the  negotiations  were  complete,  everyone  seemed
relieved  that  there  would  be  closure.  Mari �s  health  improved  enough  so
that  the  children  would  remain  with  her,41  and  the  letters  back  and  forth
from Berlin and Zurich  became friendlier.  �A  satisfactory  relationship has
formed  between  me  and  my  wife  through  the  correspondence  about  the
for
divorce!�  he 
reconciliation.�42

told  Zangger.  �A 

funny  opportunity 

indeed 

This d�tente meant that Einstein had an option for his summer vacation
of  1918:  visit  his  children  in  Zurich,  or  have  a  less  stressful  holiday  with
Elsa.  He  chose  the  latter,  partly  because  his  doctor  recommended  against
the altitude, and for seven weeks he and Elsa stayed in the Baltic Sea resort
of  Aarenshoop.  He  brought  along  some  light  beach  reading,  Immanuel
Kant�s  Prolegomena,  spent  �countless  hours  pondering  the  quantum
problem,�  and  gloried  in  relaxing  and  recovering  from  his  stomach
ailments. �No telephones, no responsibilities, absolute tranquility,� he wrote
to a friend. �I am lying on the shore like a crocodile, allowing myself to be
roasted by the sun, never see a newspaper, and do not give a hoot about the
so-called world.�43

From this unlikely vacation, he sought to mollify Hans Albert, who had
written  to  say  he  missed  his  father.�Write  me  please  why  you  aren�t
coming,  at  least,�  he  asked.44  Einstein�s  explanation  was  sad  and  very
defensive:

You  can  easily  imagine  why  I  could  not  come.  This  winter  I  was  so
sick that I had to lie in bed for over two months. Every meal must be
cooked separately for me. I may not make any abrupt movements. So
I�d have been allowed neither to go on a walk with you nor to eat at
the  hotel  .  .  .  Added  to  this  is  that  I  had  quarreled  with  Anna  Besso,
and that I did not want to become a burden to Mr. Zangger again, and
finally, that I doubted whether my coming mattered much to you.45

His  son  was  understanding.  He  wrote  him  letters  filled  with  news  and
ideas, including a description and sketch of an idea he had for a pendulum
inside a monorail that would swing and break the electric circuit whenever
the train tilted too much.

Einstein had rebuked Hans Albert, unfairly, for not finding some way to
visit him in Germany during the vacation. That would have required Mari
to waive the provision in their separation agreement that barred such trips,
and  it  would  also  have  been  sadly  impractical.  �My  coming  to  Germany
would  be  almost  more  impossible  than  your  coming  here,�  Hans  Albert
wrote, �because in the end I am the only one in the family who can shop for
anything.�46

So  Einstein,  yearning  to  be  nearer  to  his  boys,  found  himself  briefly
tempted to move back to Zurich. During his Baltic vacation that summer of

 
1918, he considered a combined offer from the University of Zurich and his
old Zurich Polytechnic. �You can design your position here exactly as you
wish,�  the  physicist  Edgar  Meyer  wrote.  As  Einstein  jokingly  noted  to
Besso,  �How  happy  I  would  have  been  18  years  ago  with  a  measly
assistantship.�47

Einstein admitted that he was tormented by the decision. Zurich was his
�true  home,�  and  Switzerland  was  the  only  country  for  which  he  felt  any
affinity. Plus, he would be near his sons.

But there was one rub. If he moved close to his sons he would be moving
close to their mother. Even for Einstein, who was good at shielding himself
from personal emotions, it would be hard to set up household with Elsa in
the  same  town  as  his  first  wife.�My  major  personal  difficulties  would
persist  if  I  pitched  my  tent  in  Zurich  again,�  he  told  Besso,  �although  it
does seem tempting to be close to my children.�48

Elsa  was  also  adamantly  opposed  to  the  prospect,  even  appalled.  She
begged  Einstein  to  promise  it  would  not  happen.  Einstein  could  be  quite
solicitous  about  Elsa�s  desires,  and  so  he  backed  away  from  a  full-time
move to Zurich.

Instead,  he  did  something  he  usually  avoided:  he  compromised.  He
retained  his  position  in  Berlin  but  agreed  to  be  a  guest  lecturer  in  Zurich,
making  month-long  visits  there  twice  a  year.  That,  he  thought,  could  give
him the best of both worlds.

In  what  seemed  like  an  excess  of  Swiss  caution,  the  Zurich  authorities
approved the lecture contract, which paid Einstein his expenses but no fee,
�by  way  of  experiment.�  They  were  in  fact  wise;  Einstein�s  lectures  were
initially  very  popular,  but  eventually  attendance  dwindled  and  they  would
be canceled after two years.

The Social Democrat

Which would finish first, Einstein had wondered half-jokingly to Mari ,
the world war or their divorce proceedings? As it turned out, both came to a
messy resolution at the end of 1918. As the German Reich was crumbling
that November, a revolt by sailors in Kiel mushroomed into a general strike
and  popular  uprising.  �Class  canceled  because  of  Revolution,�  Einstein
noted in his lecture diary on November 9, the day that protestors occupied

 
the  Reichstag  and  the  kaiser  abdicated.  Four  days  later,  a  worker-student
revolutionary council took over the University of Berlin and jailed its deans
and rector.

With  the  outbreak  of  war,  Einstein  had  become,  for  the  first  time,  an
outspoken public figure, advocating internationalism, European federalism,
and resistance to militarism. Now, the coming of the peace turned Einstein�s
political thinking toward more domestic and social issues.

From his youth as an admirer of Jost Winteler and a friend of Friedrich
Adler, Einstein had been attracted to the ideal of socialism as well as that of
individual  freedom.  The  revolution  in  Berlin�led  by  a  collection  of
socialists,  workers�  councils,  communists,  and  others  on  the  left�caused
him to confront cases when these two ideals conflicted.

For  the  rest  of  his  life  Einstein  would  expound  a  democratic  socialism
that  had  a  liberal,  anti-authoritarian  underpinning.  He  advocated  equality,
social justice, and the taming of capitalism. He was a fierce defender of the
underdog.  But  to  the  extent  that  any  revolutionaries  edged  over  toward  a
Bolshevik  desire  to  impose  centralized  control,  or  to  the  extent  that  a
regime  such  as  Russia�s  struck  him  as  authoritarian,  Einstein�s  instinctive
love of individual liberty usually provoked a disdainful reaction.

�Socialism  to  him  reflects  the  ethical  desire  to  remove  the  appalling
chasm  between  the  classes  and  to  produce  a  more  just  economic  system,�
his stepson-in-law wrote of Einstein�s attitudes during the 1920s. �And yet
he  cannot  accept  a  socialist  program.  He  appreciates  the  adventure  of
solitude and the happiness of freedom too much to welcome a system that
threatens completely to eliminate the individual.�49

It  was  an  attitude  that  remained  constant.  �Einstein�s  basic  political
philosophy  did  not  undergo  any  significant  changes  during  his  lifetime,�
said  Otto  Nathan,  a  socialist,  who  became  a  close  friend  and  then  literary
executor after Einstein moved to America. �He welcomed the revolutionary
development  of  Germany  in  1918  because  of  his  interest  in  socialism  and
particularly  because  of  his  profound  and  unqualified  devotion 
to
democracy. Basic to his political thinking was the recognition of the dignity
of the individual and the protection of political and intellectual freedom.�50
When the student revolutionaries in Berlin jailed their rector and deans,
Einstein  got  to  put  this  philosophy  into  practice.  The  physicist  Max  Born
was in bed that day with the flu when his telephone rang. It was Einstein.
He  was  heading  over  to  the  university  to  see  what  he  could  do  to  get  the

rector and deans released, and he insisted that Born get out of bed and join
him.  They  also  enlisted  a  third  friend,  the  pioneering  Gestalt  psychologist
Max  Wertheimer,  perhaps  in  the  belief  that  his  specialty  might  be  more
useful than theoretical physics in accomplishing the task.

The  three  took  the  tram  from  Einstein�s  apartment  to  the  Reichstag,
where the students were meeting. At first their way was blocked by a dense
mob,  but  the  crowd  parted  once  Einstein  was  recognized,  and  they  were
ushered to a conference room where the student soviet was meeting.

The  chairman  greeted  them  and  asked  them  to  wait  while  the  group
finished  hammering  out  their  new  statutes  for  governing  the  university.
Then  he  turned  to  Einstein.  �Before  we  come  to  your  request  to  speak,
Professor  Einstein,  may  I  be  permitted  to  ask  what  you  think  of  the  new
regulations?�

Einstein paused for a moment. Some people are innately conditioned to
hedge  their  words,  try  to  please  their  listeners,  and  enjoy  the  comfort  that
comes  from  conforming.  Not  Einstein.  Instead,  he  responded  critically.  �I
have always thought that the German university�s most valuable institution
is  academic  freedom,  whereby  the  lecturers  are  in  no  way  told  what  to
teach,  and the  students  are  able  to  choose what lectures  to  attend,  without
much supervision and control,� he said. �Your new statutes seem to abolish
all  of  this.  I  would  be  very  sorry  if  the  old  freedom  were  to  come  to  an
end.� At that point, Born recalled, �the high and mighty young gentlemen
sat in perplexed silence.�

That  did  not  help  his  mission.  After  some  discussion,  the  students
decided that they did not have the authority to release the rector and deans.
So Einstein and company went off to the Reich chancellor�s palace to seek
out  someone  who  did.  They  were  able  to  find  the  new  German  president,
who  seemed  harried  and  baffled  and  perfectly  willing  to  scribble  a  note
ordering the release.

It worked. The trio succeeded in springing their colleagues, and, as Born
recalled, �We left the Chancellor�s palace in high spirits, feeling that we had
taken part in a historical event and hoping to have seen the last of Prussian
arrogance.�51

Einstein then went down the street to a mass meeting of the revived New
Fatherland  League,  where  he  delivered  a  two-page  speech  that  he  had
carried with him to his confrontation with the students. Calling himself �an
old-time  believer  in  democracy,�  he  again  made  clear  that  his  socialist

sentiments did not make him sympathetic to Soviet-style controls. �All true
democrats  must  stand  guard  lest  the  old  class  tyranny  of  the  Right  be
replaced by a new class tyranny of the Left,� he said.

Some  on  the  left  insisted  that  democracy,  or  at  least  multiparty  liberal
democracy, needed to be put aside until the masses could be educated and a
new revolutionary consciousness take hold. Einstein disagreed. �Do not be
seduced  by  feelings  that  a  dictatorship  of  the  proletariat  is  temporarily
needed  in  order  to  hammer  the  concept  of  freedom  into  the  heads  of  our
fellow  countrymen,�  he  told  the  rally.  Instead,  he  decried  Germany�s  new
left-wing government as �dictatorial,� and he demanded that it immediately
call open elections, �thereby eliminating all fears of a new tyranny as soon
as possible.�52

Years  later,  when  Adolf  Hitler  and  his  Nazis  were  in  power,  Einstein
would ruefully look back on that day in Berlin. �Do you still remember the
occasion  some  25  years  ago  when  we  went  together  to  the  Reichstag
building,  convinced  that  we  could  turn  the  people  there  into  honest
democrats?� he wrote Born. �How na�ve we were for men of forty.�53

Marrying Elsa

Just after the war ended, so did Einstein�s divorce proceedings. As part of
the  process,  he  had  to  give  a  deposition  admitting  adultery.  On  December
23,  1918,  he  appeared  before  a  court  in  Berlin,  stood  before  a  magistrate,
and declared,�I have been living together with my cousin, the widow Elsa
Einstein, divorced L�wenthal, for about 4� years and have been continuing
these intimate relations since then.�54

As  if  to  prove  it,  he  brought  Elsa  when  he  traveled  to  Zurich  the
following month to deliver his first set of lectures there. His opening talks,
unlike his later ones, were so well attended that, to Einstein�s annoyance, an
official was posted at the door to prevent unauthorized auditors from getting
in. Hans Albert came to visit him at his hotel, presumably when Elsa was
not  there, and Einstein  spent  a few  days in  Arosa,  where  Eduard was  still
recuperating in a sanatorium.55

 
Einstein  stayed  in  Zurich  through  February  14,  when  he  stood  before
three local magistrates who granted his final divorce decree. It included the
provisions  regarding his  prospective  Nobel Prize award.  In his  deposition,
Einstein had given his religion as �dissenter,� but in the divorce decree the
clerk designated him �Mosaic.� Mari  was also designated �Mosaic,� even
though she had been born and remained a Serbian Orthodox Christian.

As  was  customary,  the  decree  included  the  order  that  �the  Defendant
[Einstein] is restrained from entering into a new marriage for the period of
two years.�56  Einstein  had  no  intention  of  obeying  that  provision.  He  had
decided  that  he  would  marry  Elsa,  and  he  would  end  up  doing  so  within
four months.

His  decision  to  remarry  was  accompanied  by  a  drama  that  was,  if  true,
weird  even  by  the  standards  of  his  unusual  family  dynamics.  It  involved
Elsa  Einstein�s  daughter  Ilse  and  the  pacifist  physician  and  adventurer
Georg Nicolai.

Ilse,  then  21,  was  the  elder  of  Elsa�s  two  daughters.  Einstein  had  hired
her as the secretary for the unbuilt Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Physics that
he was supposed to be creating (the only scientist who had been hired so far
was  his  faithful  astronomer  Freundlich).  A  spirited,  idealistic,  swanlike
beauty, Ilse�s mystique was enhanced by the fact that as a child she had lost
the use of an eye in an accident. Like a moth to flame, she was attracted to
radical politics and fascinating men.

Thus  it  was  not  surprising  that  she  fell  for  Georg  Nicolai,  who  had
collaborated  with  Einstein  in  1914  on the  pacifist  response  to  the  German
intellectuals� �Appeal to the Cultured World.� Among other things, Nicolai
was  a  doctor  specializing  in  electrocardiograms  who  had  occasionally
treated  Elsa.  A  brilliant  egomaniac  with  a  serious  sexual  appetite,  he  had
been born in Germany and had lived in Paris and Russia. During one visit to
Russia, he kept a list of the women he had sex with, totaling sixteen in all,
including two mother-daughter pairs.

Ilse fell in love with Nicolai and with his politics. In addition to being, at
least briefly, his lover, she helped type and distribute his protest letters. She
also helped persuade Einstein to support the publication of Nicolai�s pacifist
tome, The Biology of War, which included their ill-fated 1914 manifesto and
a  collection  of  liberal  writings  by  Kant  and  other  classical  German
authors.57

Einstein had initially supported this publishing project, but in early 1917
had labeled the idea �entirely hopeless.� Nicolai, who had been drafted as a
lowly medical orderly for the German army, somehow thought that Einstein
would  fund  the  endeavor,  and  he  kept  badgering  him.  �Nothing  is  more
difficult than turning Nicolai down,� Einstein wrote him, addressing him in
the  third  person.  �The  man,  who  in  other  things  is  so  sensitive  that  even
grass  growing  is  a  considerable  din  to  him,  seems  almost  deaf  when  the
sound involves a refusal.�58

On one of Ilse�s visits to see Nicolai, she told him that Einstein was now
planning  to  marry  her  mother.  Nicolai,  an  aficionado  of  the  art  of  dating
both  mother  and  daughter,  told  Ilse  that  Einstein  had  it  wrong.  He  should
marry Ilse rather than her mother.

It  is  unclear  what  psychological  game  he  was  playing  with  his  young
lover�s mind. And it is likewise unclear what psychological game she was
playing  with  his  mind,  or  her  own  mind,  when  she  wrote  him  a  detailed
letter saying that the Ilse-or-Elsa question had suddenly become a real one
for  Einstein.  The  letter  is  so  striking  and  curious  it  bears  being  quoted  at
length:

You are the only person to whom I can entrust the following and the
only  one  who  can  give  me  advice  ...  You  remember  that  we  recently
spoke about Albert�s and Mama�s marriage and you told me that you
thought  a  marriage  between  Albert  and  me  would  be  more  proper.  I
never thought seriously about it until yesterday. Yesterday, the question
was  suddenly  raised  about  whether  Albert  wished  to  marry  Mama  or
me.  This  question,  initially  posed  half  in  jest,  became  within  a  few
minutes a serious matter which must now be considered and discussed
fully  and  completely.  Albert  himself  is  refusing  to  take  any  decision,
he is prepared to marry either me or Mama. I know that Albert loves
me very much, perhaps more than any other man ever will. He told me
so himself yesterday. On the one hand, he might even prefer me as his
wife,  since  I  am  young  and  he  could  have  children  with  me,  which
naturally does not apply at all in Mama�s case; but he is far too decent
and loves Mama too much ever to mention it. You know how I stand
with Albert. I love him very much; I have the greatest respect for him
as a person. If ever there was true friendship and camaraderie between
two beings of different types, those are quite certainly my feelings for

Albert. I have never wished nor felt the least desire to be close to him
physically. This is otherwise in his case�recently at least. He admitted
to  me  once  how  difficult  it  is  for  him  to  keep  himself  in  check.  But
now  I  do  believe  that  my  feelings  for  him  are  not  sufficient  for
conjugal life . . . The third person still to be mentioned in this odd and
certainly also highly comical affair would be Mother. For the present
�because she does not yet firmly believe that I am really serious. She
has  allowed  me  to  choose  completely  freely.  If  she  saw  that  I  could
really  be  happy  only  with  Albert,  she  would  surely  step  aside  out  of
love for me. But it would certainly be bitterly hard for her. And then I
do not know whether it really would be fair if�after all her years of
struggle�I were to compete with her over the place she had won for
herself,  now  that  she  is  finally  at  the  goal.  Philistines  like  the
grandparents  are  naturally  appalled  about  these  new  plans.  Mother
would  supposedly  be  disgraced  and  other  such  unpleasant  things  .  .  .
Albert also thought that if I did not wish to have a child of his it would
be nicer for me not to be married to him. And I truly do not have this
wish. It will seem peculiar to you that I, a silly little thing of a 20-year-
old,  should  have  to  decide  on  such  a  serious  matter;  I  can  hardly
believe  it  myself  and  feel  very  unhappy  doing  so  as  well.  Help  me!
Yours, Ilse.59

She  wrote  a  big  note  on  top  of  the  first  page:  �Please  destroy  this  letter
immediately after reading it!� Nicolai didn�t.

Was it true? Was it half-true? Was the truth relative to the observer? The
only  evidence we  have of Einstein�s mother-daughter dithering  is  this  one
letter. No one else, then or in recollections, ever mentioned the issue. The
letter was written by an intense and love-struck young woman to a dashing
philanderer whose attentions she craved. Perhaps it was merely her fantasy,
or  her  ploy  to  provoke  Nicolai�s  jealousy.  As  with  much  of  nature,
especially human nature, the underlying reality, if there is such a thing, may
not be knowable.

As it turned out, Einstein married Elsa in June 1919, and Ilse ended up

remaining close to both of them.

Einstein�s  family  relations  seemed  to  be  improving  on  all  fronts.  The
very next month, he went to Zurich to see his boys, and he stayed with Hans

 
Albert  at  his  first  wife�s  apartment  while  she  was  away.  Elsa  seemed
worried about that arrangement, but he reassured her in at least two letters
that  Mari   would  not  be  around  much.  �Camping  in  the  lioness�s  den  is
proving  very  worthwhile,�  he  said  in  one,  �and  there�s  no  fear  of  any
incident  happening.�  Together  he  and  Hans  Albert  went  sailing,  played
music, and built a model airplane together. �The boy gives me indescribable
joy,�  he  wrote  Elsa.  �He  is  very  diligent  and  persistent  in  everything  he
does. He also plays piano very nicely.�60

His relations with his first family were now so calm that, during his July
1919  visit,  he  once  again  thought  that  maybe  he  should  move  there  with
Elsa  and  her  daughters.  This  completely  flummoxed  Elsa,  who  made  her
feelings very clear. Einstein backed down. �We�re going to stay in Berlin,
all right,� he reassured her. �So calm down and never fear!�61

Einstein�s new marriage was different from his first. It was not romantic
or passionate. From the start, he and Elsa had separate bedrooms at opposite
ends  of 
intellectual.
Understanding  relativity,  she  later  said,  �is  not  necessary  for  my
happiness.�62

their  rambling  Berlin  apartment.  Nor  was 

it 

She was, on the other hand, talented in practical ways that often eluded
her  husband.  She  spoke  French  and  English  well,  which  allowed  her  to
serve  as  his  translator  as  well  as  manager  when  he  traveled.  �I  am  not
talented in any direction except perhaps as wife and mother,� she said. �My
interest in mathematics is mainly in the household bills.�63

That  comment  reflects  her  humility  and  a  simmering  insecurity,  but  it
sells her short. It was no simple task to play the role of wife and mother to
Einstein, who required both, nor to manage their finances and logistics. She
did it with good sense and warmth. Even though, every now and then, she
succumbed to a few pretenses that came with their standing, she generally
displayed an unaffected manner and self-aware humor, and in doing so she
thus helped make sure that her husband retained those traits as well.

The marriage was, in fact, a solid symbiosis, and it served adequately, for
the most part, the needs and desires of both partners. Elsa was an efficient
and lively  woman, who was  eager  to  serve  and protect  him. She  liked his
fame, and (unlike him) did not try to hide that fact. She also appreciated the
social standing it gave them, even if it meant she had to merrily shoo away
reporters and other invaders of her husband�s privacy.

He  was  as pleased to  be looked  after as she was  to  look  after him. She
told him when to eat and where to go. She packed his suitcases and doled
out  his  pocket  money. In public, she was  protective  of the  man  she called
�the Professor� or even simply �Einstein.�

That allowed him to spend hours in a rather dreamy state, focusing more
on  the  cosmos  than  on  the  world  around  him.  All  of  which  gave  her
excitement  and  satisfaction.  �The  Lord  has  put  into  him  so  much  that�s
beautiful,  and  I  find  him  wonderful,  even  though  life  at  his  side  is
enervating and difficult,� she once said.64

When Einstein was in one of his periods of intense work, as was often the
case,  Elsa  �recognized  the  need  for  keeping  all  disturbing  elements  away
from him,� a relative noted. She would make his favorite meal of lentil soup
and sausages, summon him down from his study, and then would leave him
alone as he mechanically ate his meal. But when he would mutter or protest,
she  would  remind  him  that  it  was  important  for  him  to  eat.�People  have
centuries to find things out,� she would say, �but your stomach, no, it will
not wait for centuries.�65

She came to know, from a faraway look in his eyes, when he was �seized
with  a  problem,�  as  she  called  it,  and  thus  should  not  be  disturbed.  He
would  pace  up  and  down  in  his  study,  and  she  would  have  food  sent  up.
When  his  intense  concentration  was  over,  he  would  finally  come  down to
the table for a meal and, sometimes, ask to go on a walk with Elsa and her
daughters.  They  always  complied,  but  they  never  initiated  such  a  request.
�It is he who has to do the asking,� a newspaper reported after interviewing
her, �and when he asks them for a walk they know that his mind is relieved
of work.�66

Elsa�s daughter Ilse would eventually marry Rudolf Kayser, editor of the
premier literary magazine in Germany, and they set up a house filled with
art and artists and writers. Margot, who liked sculpting, was so shy that she
would  sometimes  hide  under  the  table  when  guests  of  her  father  arrived.
She lived at home even after she married, in 1930, a Russian named Dimitri
Marianoff.  Both  of  these  sons-in-law,  it  turned  out,  would  end  up  writing
florid but undistinguished books about the Einstein family.

For  the  time  being,  Einstein  and  Elsa  and  her  two  daughters  lived
together in a spacious and somberly furnished apartment near the center of
Berlin. The wallpaper was dark green, the tablecloths white linen with lace
embroidery. �One felt that Einstein would always remain a stranger in such

a household,� said his friend and colleague Philipp Frank, �a Bohemian as a
guest in a bourgeois home.�

In  defiance  of  building  codes,  they  converted  three  attic  rooms  into  a
garret  study  with  a  big  new  window.  It  was  occasionally  dusted,  never
tidied, and papers piled up under the benign gazes of Newton, Maxwell, and
Faraday.  There  Einstein  would  sit  in  an  old  armchair,  pad  on  his  knee.
Occasionally  he  would  get  up  to  pace,  then  he  would  sit  back  down  to
scribble the equations that would, he hoped, extend his theory of relativity
into an explanation of the cosmos.67

CHAPTER ELEVEN
EINSTEIN�S UNIVERSE
1916�1919

In his Berlin home study

Cosmology and Black Holes, 1917

Cosmology is the study of the universe as a whole, including its size and
shape, its history and destiny, from one end to the other, from the beginning
to the end of time. That�s a big topic. And it�s not a simple one. It�s not even
simple to define what those concepts mean, or even if they have meaning.
With  the  gravitational  field  equations  in  his  general  theory  of  relativity,
Einstein laid the foundations for studying the nature of the universe, thereby
becoming the primary founder of modern cosmology.

 
 
 
 
Helping him in this endeavor, at least in the early stages, was a profound
mathematician  and  even  more  distinguished  astrophysicist,  Karl
Schwarzschild,  who  directed  the  Potsdam  Observatory.  He  read  Einstein�s
new  formulation  of  general  relativity  and,  at  the  beginning  of  1916,  set
about trying to apply it to objects in space.

One thing made Schwarzschild�s work very difficult. He had volunteered
for the German military during the war, and when he read Einstein�s papers
he  was  stationed  in  Russia,  projecting  the  trajectory  of  artillery  shells.
Nevertheless,  he  was  also  able  to  find  time  to  calculate  what  the
gravitational  field  would  be,  according  to  Einstein�s  theory,  around  an
object in space. It was the wartime counterpart to Einstein�s ability to come
up with the special theory of relativity while examining patent applications
for the synchronization of clocks.

In  January  1916,  Schwarzschild  mailed  his  result  to  Einstein  with  the
declaration  that  it  permitted  his  theory  �to  shine  with  increased  purity.�
Among  other  things,  it  reconfirmed,  with  greater  rigor,  the  success  of
Einstein�s equations in explaining Mercury�s orbit. Einstein was thrilled. �I
would  not  have  expected  that  the  exact  solution  to  the  problem  could  be
formulated  so  simply,�  he  replied.  The  following  Thursday,  he  personally
delivered the paper at the Prussian Academy�s weekly meeting.1

Schwarzschild�s first calculations focused on the curvature of space-time
outside  a  spherical,  nonspinning  star.  A  few  weeks  later,  he  sent  Einstein
another paper on what it would be like inside such a star.

In  both  cases,  something  unusual  seemed  possible,  indeed  inevitable.  If
all  the  mass  of  a  star  (or  any  object)  was  compressed  into  a  tiny  enough
space�defined by what became known as the Schwarzschild radius�then
all  of  the  calculations  seemed  to  break  down.  At  the  center,  spacetime
would infinitely curve in on itself. For our sun, that would happen if all of
its mass were compressed into a radius of less than two miles. For the earth,
it would happen if all the mass were compressed into a radius of about one-
third of an inch.

What  would  that  mean?  In  such  a  situation,  nothing  within  the
Schwarzschild  radius  would  be  able  to  escape  the  gravitational  pull,  not
even  light  or  any  other  form  of  radiation.  Time  would  also  be  part  of  the
warpage  as  well,  dilated  to  zero.  In  other  words,  a  traveler  nearing  the
Schwarzschild radius would appear, to someone on the outside, to freeze to
a halt.

Einstein  did  not  believe,  then  or  later,  that  these  results  actually
corresponded  to  anything  real.  In  1939,  for  example,  he  produced  a  paper
that  provided,  he  said,  �a  clear  understanding  as 
these
�Schwarzschild singularities� do not exist in physical reality.� A few months
later,  however,  J.  Robert  Oppenheimer  and  his  student  Hart-land  Snyder
argued  the  opposite,  predicting  that  stars  could  undergo  a  gravitational
collapse.2

to  why 

As for Schwarzschild, he never had the chance to study the issue further.
Weeks  after  writing  his  papers,  he  contracted  a  horrible  auto-immune
disease while on the front, which ate away at his skin cells, and he died that
May at age 42.

As scientists would discover after Einstein�s death, Schwarzschild�s odd
theory was right. Stars could collapse and create such a phenomenon, and in
fact  they  often  did.  In  the  1960s,  physicists  such  as  Stephen  Hawking,
Roger  Penrose,  John  Wheeler,  Freeman  Dyson,  and  Kip  Thorne  showed
that this was indeed a feature of Einstein�s general theory of relativity, one
that was very real. Wheeler dubbed them �black holes,� and they have been
a feature of cosmology, as well as Star Trek episodes, ever since.3

Black  holes  have  now  been  discovered  all  over  the  universe,  including
one  at  the  center  of  our  galaxy  that  is  a  few  million  times  more  massive
than  our  sun.  �Black  holes  are  not  rare,  and  they  are  not  an  accidental
embellishment of our universe,� says Dyson. �They are the only places in
the universe where Einstein�s theory of relativity shows its full power and
glory.  Here,  and  nowhere  else,  space  and  time  lose  their  individuality  and
merge  together  in  a  sharply  curved  four-dimensional  structure  precisely
delineated by Einstein�s equations.�4

Einstein believed that his general theory solved Newton�s bucket issue in
a way that Mach would have liked: inertia (or centrifugal forces) would not
exist  for  something  spinning  in  a  completely  empty  universe.*  Instead,
inertia  was  caused  only  by  rotation  relative  to  all  the  other  objects  in  the
universe. �According to my theory, inertia is simply an interaction between
masses,  not  an  effect  in  which  �space�  of  itself  is  involved,  separate  from
the observed mass,� Einstein told Schwarzschild. �It can be put this way. If
I allow all things to vanish, then according to Newton the Galilean inertial
space remains; following my interpretation, however, nothing remains.�5

The  issue  of  inertia  got  Einstein  into  a  debate  with  one  of  the  great
astronomers  of  the  time,  Willem  de  Sitter  of  Leiden.  Throughout  1916,

Einstein struggled to preserve the relativity of inertia and Mach�s principle
by  using  all  sorts  of  constructs,  including  assuming  various  �border
conditions� such as distant masses along the fringes of space that were, by
necessity,  unable  to  be  observed.  As  de  Sitter  noted,  that  in  itself  would
have  been  anathema  to  Mach,  who  railed  against  postulating  things  that
could not possibly be observed.6

By February 1917, Einstein had come up with a new approach. �I have
completely  abandoned  my  views,  rightly  contested  by  you,�  he  wrote  de
Sitter. �I am curious to hear what you will have to say about the somewhat
crazy idea I am considering now.�7 It was an idea that initially struck him as
so wacky that he told his friend Paul Ehrenfest in Leiden, �It exposes me to
the danger of being confined to a madhouse.� He jokingly asked Ehrenfest
for assurances, before he came to visit, that there were no such asylums in
Leiden.8

His  new  idea  was  published  that  month  in  what  became  yet  another
seminal  Einstein  paper,  �Cosmological  Considerations  in  the  General
Theory of Relativity.�9 On the surface, it did indeed seem to be based on a
crazy notion: space has no borders because gravity bends it back on itself.

Einstein  began  by  noting  that  an  absolutely  infinite  universe  filled  with
stars and other objects was not plausible. There would be an infinite amount
of  gravity  tugging  at  every  point  and  an  infinite  amount  of  light  shining
from every direction. On the other hand, a finite universe floating at some
random  location  in  space  was  inconceivable  as  well.  Among  other  things,
what  would  keep  the  stars  and  energy  from  flying  off,  escaping,  and
depleting the universe?

So  he  developed  a  third  option:  a  finite  universe,  but  one  without
boundaries. The masses in the universe caused space to curve, and over the
expanse  of  the  universe  they  caused  space  (indeed,  the  whole  four-
dimensional  fabric  of  spacetime)  to  curve  completely  in  on  itself.  The
system is closed and finite, but there is no end or edge to it.

One method that Einstein employed to help people visualize this notion
was to begin by imagining two-dimensional explorers on a two-dimensional
universe, like a flat surface. These �flatlanders� can wander in any direction
on this flat surface, but the concept of going up or down has no meaning to
them.

Now,  imagine  this  variation:  What  if  these  flatlanders�  two  dimensions
were still on a surface, but this surface was (in a way very subtle to them)

gently  curved?  What  if  they  and  their  world  were  still  confined  to  two
dimensions,  but  their  flat  surface  was  like  the  surface  of  a  globe?  As
Einstein put it, �Let us consider now a two-dimensional existence, but this
time on a spherical surface instead of on a plane.� An arrow shot by these
flatlanders  would  still  seem  to  travel  in  a  straight  line,  but  eventually  it
would curve around and come back�just as a sailor on the surface of our
planet  heading  straight off  over the  seas  would  eventually return from the
other horizon.

The  curvature  of  the  flatlanders�  two-dimensional  space  makes  their
surface  finite,  and  yet  they  can  find  no  boundaries.  No  matter  what
direction they travel, they reach no end or edge of their universe, but they
eventually get back to the same place. As Einstein put it, �The great charm
resulting from this consideration lies in the recognition that the universe of
these beings is finite and yet has no limits.� And if the flatlanders� surface
was  like  that  of  an  inflating  balloon,  their  whole  universe  could  be
expanding, yet there would still be no boundaries to it.10

By  extension,  we  can  try  to  imagine,  as  Einstein  has  us  do,  how  three-
dimensional  space  can  be  similarly  curved  to  create  a  closed  and  finite
system that has no edge. It�s not easy for us three-dimensional creatures to
visualize,  but  it  is  easily  described  mathematically  by  the  non-Euclidean
geometries  pioneered  by  Gauss  and  Riemann.  It  can  work  for  four
dimensions of spacetime as well.

In  such  a  curved  universe,  a  beam  of  light  starting  out  in  any  direction
could  travel  what  seems  to  be  a  straight  line  and  yet  still  curve  back  on
itself.  �This  suggestion  of  a  finite  but  unbounded  space  is  one  of  the
greatest  ideas  about  the  nature  of  the  world  which  has  ever  been
conceived,� the physicist Max Born has declared.11

Yes, but what is outside this curved universe? What�s on the other side of
the curve? That�s not merely an unanswerable question, it�s a meaningless
one, just as it would  be meaningless  for  a flatlander  to  ask what�s outside
her  surface.  One  could  speculate,  imaginatively  or  mathematically,  about
what things are like in a fourth spatial dimension, but other than in science
fiction it is not very meaningful to ask what�s in a realm that exists outside
of the three spatial dimensions of our curved universe.12

This concept of the cosmos that Einstein derived from his general theory
of relativity was elegant and magical. But there seemed to be one hitch, a
flaw  that  needed  to  be  fixed  or  fudged.  His  theory  indicated  that  the

universe  would  have  to  be  either  expanding  or  contracting,  not  staying
static.  According  to  his  field  equations,  a  static  universe  was  impossible
because the gravitational forces would pull all the matter together.

This  did  not  accord  with  what  most  astronomers  thought  they  had
observed.  As  far  as  they  knew,  the  universe  consisted  only  of  our  Milky
Way galaxy, and it all seemed pretty stable and static. The stars appeared to
be  meandering  gently,  but  not  receding  rapidly  as  part  of  an  expanding
universe.  Other  galaxies,  such  as  Andromeda,  were  merely  unexplained
blurs in  the  sky. (A  few  Americans working at  the  Lowell  Observatory  in
Arizona had noticed that the spectra of some mysterious spiral nebulae were
shifted to the red end of the spectrum, but scientists had not yet determined
that these were distant galaxies all speeding away from our own.)

When  the  conventional  wisdom  of  physics  seemed  to  conflict  with  an
elegant theory of his, Einstein was inclined to question that wisdom rather
than  his  theory,  often  to  have  his  stubbornness  rewarded.  In  this  case,  his
gravitational field equations seemed to imply�indeed, screamed out�that
the conventional thinking about a stable universe was wrong and should be
tossed aside, just as Newton�s concept of absolute time was.13

Instead, this time he made what he called a �slight modification� to his
theory. To keep the matter in the universe from imploding, Einstein added a
�repulsive�  force:  a  little  addition  to  his  general  relativity  equations  to
counterbalance gravity in the overall scheme.

In  his  revised  equations,  this  modification  was  signified  by  the  Greek
letter lambda,
